# Security gate (plan blocker 1): the LoadBalancer archive must NOT contain
# privileged code. The LB build copies LB_DIRS and then removes LB_DIRS_TO_REMOVE
# / LB_FILES_TO_REMOVE. After the PascalCase rename (Фаза 1) a stale lowercase
# remove path would silently miss, leaking Admin/Reseller controllers, the
# user/device domain and cron jobs to an internet-facing DMZ node.
#
# This reproduces the Makefile's LB file selection from the real LB_* variables
# (no tarball needed) and asserts that:
#   - every LB list entry still matches a tracked path under src/ (STALE) of the
#     kind its list expects (WRONG-LIST),
#   - the sensitive trees are absent (LEAK),
#   - every script lb_configs/nginx.conf executes still ships (MISSING),
#   - the LB update's deleted-files list names no shipped file (DELETES-SHIPPED).
