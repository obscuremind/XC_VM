# Updating a Server

Step-by-step guide to updating an XC_VM server. For the internals of the update process, see [Update Mechanism](../administration/update-system.md).

> 💾 Before updating, it is recommended to create a [backup](../administration/backup-strategy.md).

## Updating via the Panel

**Step 1.** Open the **Servers** section in the top menu of the panel.

**Step 2.** Select **Manage Servers** from the dropdown menu.

**Step 3.** Locate the target server in the servers table and click the menu button in the **Actions** column.

**Step 4.** Select **Server Tools** from the menu.

**Step 5.** In the **Server Tools** dialog, click **Update Server**.

Clicking the button inserts an `update` signal into the database. Within a minute, CRON picks it up and the update runs automatically: the panel is stopped, updated, and restarted. You can track progress via the server version in the **Manage Servers** table.

## Manual Update (CLI)

```bash
sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/console.php update update
```

Downloads and applies the latest update from GitHub. Usually triggered automatically through the web panel.

## Update Channels

**Settings → General → Updates** sets the release channel for each component. The panel channel also applies to every load balancer.

| Channel | Panel receives |
|---------|----------------|
| `Stable` | Stable releases only |
| `Beta` | Stable releases and pre-releases |
| `Dev (nightly)` | Everything in `Beta`, plus nightly builds of the `main` branch (`X.Y.Z-dev.N`) |

`Dev` is offered for the panel only. Nightly builds are published to the separate [XC_VM_Dev](https://github.com/Vateron-Media/XC_VM_Dev/releases) repository, at most once a day and only when `main` has changed.

> ⚠️ Nightly builds are untested. Use `Dev` on test servers only: a nightly may apply a database migration that a later build revises.

To leave `Dev`, switch the channel back to `Stable`. A nightly `X.Y.Z-dev.N` is older than the release `X.Y.Z`, so the panel updates to that release as soon as it is published. To return to the previous release right away, use a [rollback](#rolling-back-a-server). Nightly builds are never offered as rollback targets.

## Rolling Back a Server

If an update introduces a problem, you can roll a server back to an earlier release directly from the panel. Rollback works per-server, so both the **MAIN** panel and individual **Load Balancers** can be downgraded independently.

**Step 1.** Open the **Servers** section → **Manage Servers**.

**Step 2.** Locate the target server and open its **Actions** menu (the same menu used for updating).

**Step 3.** Click **Rollback Version**. A dialog opens listing earlier releases (newest first). Pre-release builds are tagged `(beta)`.

**Step 4.** Select the version to roll back to and confirm.

Clicking **Rollback** inserts a `rollback` signal (carrying the chosen version) into the database. Within a minute CRON picks it up and the rollback runs automatically, reusing the same stop → replace → restart flow as an update. Track progress via the server version in the **Manage Servers** table.

> 💾 On the **MAIN** server a database backup is taken automatically before the rollback, saved to `/home/xc_vm/backups/pre_rollback_<from>_to_<to>_<timestamp>.sql`. Load balancers have no database, so this step is skipped.

The versions offered depend on the server's update channel: on the `stable` channel only stable releases are listed; on `beta` and `dev` you also see `(beta)` pre-releases.

> ⚠️ A rollback **does not undo database migrations** — they are forward-only. The schema is designed to stay backward-compatible, and the automatic backup is the recovery path if an older build cannot read newer data. Use rollback only as a recovery step.

### Manual Rollback (CLI)

```bash
sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/console.php update rollback 2.4.0
```

Downloads the specified release from GitHub and applies it, with the same integrity checks and — on MAIN — the automatic database backup.
