# Generating SSL Certificate for Nginx in XC_VM

This guide explains how to create a self-signed SSL certificate to enable secure HTTPS connections for the built-in Nginx server in the XC_VM project.

> **Note:** A fresh install already generates a **unique** self-signed certificate
> automatically (the installer runs `openssl` and writes `server.key`/`server.crt`
> into `bin/nginx/conf/` before Nginx starts), and `CertbotCronJob` later replaces
> it with a real Let's Encrypt certificate. Follow this guide only to **regenerate
> or replace** the certificate manually.
>
> A load balancer, or an older install, that still has the placeholder key from
> the archive gets its own key and certificate at its next start
> (`console.php startup`, which then reloads Nginx). The placeholder key is in the
> repository, so every node using it shared one private key. A key you put there
> yourself is never replaced.
>
> The `ssl.conf` that ships allows TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only. A node still running the
> earlier shipped `ssl.conf` (SSLv3, TLS 1.1 and 1.2) gets the new one at the same
> start. An `ssl.conf` you edited, or one certbot wrote, is kept as it is.

## Overview

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** encrypts the connection between client and server, ensuring data confidentiality and user trust.  
This tutorial shows how to create a **self-signed SSL certificate** for the embedded **Nginx** server in the **XC_VM** project.

---

## Configuration Location

All SSL-related files (key, certificate, and config) are stored in:

```bash
/home/xc_vm/bin/nginx/conf
```

Navigate to this directory before proceeding:

```bash
cd /home/xc_vm/bin/nginx/conf
```

---

## Step 1. Generate Private Key

Generate a **2048-bit RSA private key**:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
```

After execution, the file `server.key` will appear — this is your **private key**.  
Keep it **strictly confidential** — it is used to sign the SSL certificate.

---

## Step 2. Create server.cnf Configuration File

Create a configuration file containing certificate parameters:

```bash
cat > server.cnf << EOF
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = RU
ST = Moscow
L = Moscow
O = XC_VM
OU = XC_VM
CN = XC_VM

[v3_req]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = XC_VM
EOF
```

**Parameter explanation:**

| Field | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C` | RU | Country |
| `ST` | Moscow | State/Province |
| `L` | Moscow | City/Locality |
| `O` | XC_VM | Organization |
| `OU` | XC_VM | Organizational Unit |
| `CN` | XC_VM | Common Name (primary hostname) |
| `DNS.1` | XC_VM | Subject Alternative Name (SAN) |

> **Tip:** For real domain names, replace `DNS.1 = XC_VM` with your actual domain (e.g., `DNS.1 = panel.example.com`) to avoid browser warnings.

---

## Step 3. Generate Self-Signed SSL Certificate

Generate the certificate using the private key and configuration file:

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650 -config server.cnf
```

**Explanation:**

- `-new -x509` — creates a new self-signed certificate
- `-days 3650` — certificate validity period (10 years)
- `-config server.cnf` — uses the custom configuration
- Result: `server.crt` file containing the public certificate

---

## Final Files

After completing all steps, the following files should be present in `/home/xc_vm/bin/nginx/conf`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `server.key` | Private key |
| `server.crt` | Self-signed SSL certificate |
| `server.cnf` | Certificate configuration file |

---

## Result

Your **XC_VM Nginx server** is now accessible via **HTTPS** using the newly created self-signed certificate.  
Browsers will display a “not trusted” warning — this is expected behavior for self-signed certificates.

---

## Notes

- Self-signed certificates are suitable **for internal use or testing only**.
- For public-facing domains, use certificates from trusted CAs (e.g., [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)).
- If you change the Domain/hostname (`CN` or `DNS.1`), you **must regenerate** the certificate.
- To inspect the generated certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout
```
