# Backup Strategy

XC_VM supports automated and manual database backups with local storage and optional Dropbox upload.
Backups are managed through the admin panel, CLI commands, and a cron job.

---

## What Gets Backed Up

Backups contain the complete database structure and data, **except** the following tables:

```text
detect_restream_logs, epg_data, lines_activity, lines_live,
lines_logs, login_logs, mag_claims, mag_logs, mysql_syslog,
panel_logs, panel_stats, servers_stats, signals,
streams_errors, streams_logs, streams_stats, syskill_log,
users_credits_logs, users_logs, watch_logs
```

> **Note:** Restoring a backup clears all log data. These tables are excluded to keep backup sizes manageable.

Backups do **not** include:

- File system data (recordings, VOD files, EPG XML)
- Configuration files (`config/`)
- Binary dependencies (`bin/`)
- Temporary files (`tmp/`)

---

## Configuration

Settings are in the admin panel under **Backups**:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `automatic_backups` | `off` | frequency: `off`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` |
| `backups_to_keep` | `0` | local retention count (0 = unlimited) |
| `dropbox_remote` | `0` | enable Dropbox upload |
| `dropbox_keep` | `0` | remote retention count (0 = unlimited) |
| `dropbox_token` | `''` | Dropbox API token |

---

## Creating Backups

### Manual (admin panel)

Click **Create Backup Now** in the backups page. This runs the cron job in force mode:

```bash
/home/xc_vm/console.php cron:backups 1
```

### Automatic (cron)

The `cron:backups` job checks the schedule on each run:

| Schedule | Interval |
| --- | --- |
| `hourly` | 3600s |
| `daily` | 86400s |
| `weekly` | 604800s |
| `monthly` | 2419200s |

Only runs on the main server (`is_main=1`). Uses PID-based locking to prevent overlapping runs.

### Backup process

1. Close MySQL connection before dump.
2. Run `mysqldump --no-data` (structure) + `mysqldump --ignore-table` (data, excluding log tables).
3. Validate file size (empty files are deleted).
4. If Dropbox enabled: upload with status tracking.
5. Apply retention policy (delete oldest files exceeding limit).

### File location

```text
/home/xc_vm/backups/backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.sql
```

---

## Restoring Backups

### From admin panel

Click **Restore** on any backup entry. Requires confirmation.

Process:

1. If local file exists, use it. Otherwise download from Dropbox to `/home/xc_vm/tmp/restore.sql`.
2. Drop and recreate the database.
3. Import the SQL file.
4. Re-dump structure after import.

```php
BackupService::restore($filename, $config)
```

> **Important:** Restore drops the entire database and recreates it. All data not in the backup will be lost.

### From CLI

For migration scenarios with selective table import:

```bash
sudo /home/xc_vm/console.php tools migration /path/to/backup.sql
```

This restores to a `xc_vm_migrate` database for selective data migration, rather than overwriting the live database.

---

## Retention

### Local retention

- If `backups_to_keep > 0`: keeps only the N most recent files. Oldest deleted first.
- If `backups_to_keep = 0`: keeps all files (unlimited).

### Remote retention

- If `dropbox_keep > 0`: keeps only the N most recent files on Dropbox. Oldest deleted first.
- If `dropbox_keep = 0`: keeps all remote files (unlimited).

Cleanup runs automatically after each backup via `BackupsCronJob`.

---

## Dropbox Integration

File: `src/Core/Storage/DropboxClient.php`

When `dropbox_remote` is enabled:

1. After local backup creation, upload to Dropbox.
2. A `.uploading` marker file is created during upload.
3. On success: `.uploading` is deleted.
4. On failure: `.error` file is created with the error message.

Admin panel status indicators:

| Indicator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Green | successfully uploaded |
| Yellow | currently uploading (< 10 minutes old) |
| Red | upload failed (hover for error message) |
| Gray | not uploaded |

Methods:

```php
BackupService::checkRemoteConnection()        // validate Dropbox token
BackupService::uploadRemote($path, $filename, $overwrite = true)  // upload backup
BackupService::downloadRemote($path, $filename) // download backup
BackupService::deleteRemote($path)             // delete remote backup
BackupService::getRemote()                     // list remote backups
```

---

## CLI Commands

### cron:backups

Automated backup cron job. Can be forced with argument `1`:

```bash
sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/console.php cron:backups
sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/console.php cron:backups 1  # force
```

### tools migration

Restore a backup to a migration database for selective import:

```bash
sudo /home/xc_vm/console.php tools migration /path/to/backup.sql
```

### tools database --confirm

Reset to a blank database (destroys all data):

```bash
sudo /home/xc_vm/console.php tools database --confirm
```

### tools mysql

Re-authorize load balancers on MySQL:

```bash
sudo /home/xc_vm/console.php tools mysql
```

---

## API Endpoint

Action: `backup` (requires `adv:database` permission)

| Sub-action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `backup` | trigger immediate backup (background) |
| `delete` | delete local backup + Dropbox copy |
| `restore` | restore database from backup |

---

## Cluster keys (MAIN replacement)

The database backup does not contain MAIN's **cluster keys**. When the cluster API is enabled, enrolled load balancers trust those keys, and `xcvm_core` seals them to MAIN's machine. A backup made on one machine cannot be read on another. Without a separate export, replacing MAIN's hardware means re-enrolling every node.

**Export** (on MAIN, after enabling the cluster API, and again whenever you like):

```bash
php console.php cluster:export-keys /root/cluster-keys.xcdr
```

- You type a passphrase twice; it is not echoed. It needs 20+ characters, or 12+ using three character classes. `--passphrase-file=<path>` reads it from a file instead.
- The bundle is written 0600 and never overwrites an existing file.
- The key derivation uses about 1 GiB of memory for a few seconds.
- Keep the bundle and the passphrase **apart**, and both off MAIN. The bundle opens only inside `xcvm_core`, and only with the passphrase.

**Import** (on the replacement MAIN, after restoring the database and before any node reconnects):

```bash
php console.php cluster:import-keys /root/cluster-keys.xcdr
```

- **Retire the old MAIN first.** Two MAINs sharing the same keys issue tokens independently, and a node revoked on one stays valid on the other.
- Revoked nodes stay revoked. The import refuses to replace a *different* set of keys already on the machine. Importing the same bundle twice changes nothing.
- Nodes re-key by themselves once they reach the new MAIN. Tokens issued by the old MAIN do not open on the new machine, and the agents replace them automatically.

**No bundle:** run `php console.php cluster:init` on the new MAIN, which creates new keys. Then re-enrol every node over SSH with `cluster:reenrol`, after restoring the database:

1. Write the nodes' SSH credentials to an owner-only file in `bin/install/`. The top level applies to every node; `nodes` overrides it per server ID:

    ```bash
    sudo -u xc_vm sh -c 'umask 077; cat > /home/xc_vm/bin/install/fleet.cred' <<'EOF'
    {"u": "root", "p": "root-password",
     "nodes": {"7": {"p": "other-password", "port": 2222, "hostkey": "SHA1:…"}}}
    EOF
    ```

    A node needs a `hostkey` only when the database holds none for it, for example a node installed before host keys were recorded, or one rebuilt since. Read it on the node with `ssh-keygen -l -E sha1 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`. A node with no key at all is never contacted. The SSH port defaults to the one the node was installed with, then the file's top-level `port`, then 22.

2. Check what would happen. A dry run contacts no node and keeps the file:

    ```bash
    sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/console.php cluster:reenrol --all --cred-file=/home/xc_vm/bin/install/fleet.cred --dry-run
    ```

3. Re-enrol one node by ID and check that it comes up on *Servers → Cluster Nodes*. Then re-enrol the others, by ID or with `--all` (which takes the first node again). A real run deletes the file as soon as it has read it, so write the file again before each run:

    ```bash
    sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/console.php cluster:reenrol 7 --cred-file=/home/xc_vm/bin/install/fleet.cred
    sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/console.php cluster:reenrol --all --cred-file=/home/xc_vm/bin/install/fleet.cred
    ```

- `--all` takes the nodes that are enrolling or active. Revoked and quarantined nodes stay as they are, unless you name them or pass `--state=`.
- A node that fails is listed with the reason, and the run goes on: for example a changed host key, a node that does not run this release yet, or a node that cannot reach MAIN's cluster API. Fix the cause and name the node in a new run. The node's agent was already stopped and given new keys if the run got as far as the reachability check, so it may not work again until that new run.
- A licence refusal stops the run before the next node.
- Each re-enrolled node starts over like a new node: in the mode *New Node Mode* (Settings → Cluster) gives, with every flow off. Switch its flows on again on *Servers → Cluster Nodes*.
- `server:enrol` still re-enrols a single node.
