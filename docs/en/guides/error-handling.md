# Error Handling Model

XC_VM error handling has three layers:

- **Error codes** -- what failed (centralized registry of named error strings)
- **Error handlers** -- how the client HTTP response is produced (`generateError()`, `generate404()`)
- **Logger subsystem** -- runtime capture of PHP errors, uncaught exceptions, and fatal crashes

---

## Flow Overview

```text
Application code
  |
  +-- generateError('CODE')        // deliberate error response
  |     -> debug mode:  styled HTML page with code + description
  |     -> production:  generate404() or explicit HTTP code
  |
  +-- PHP warning / notice / error  // runtime errors
  |     -> Logger::handleError()
  |        -> maps errno to level (ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO)
  |        -> writes base64-encoded JSON to error_log.log
  |        -> optionally displays on screen
  |
  +-- Uncaught exception            // unhandled Throwable
  |     -> Logger::handleException()
  |        -> logs as EXCEPTION with full chained trace
  |
  +-- Fatal error at shutdown       // E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_ERROR
        -> Logger::handleFatal()
           -> logs as FATAL (no stack trace available)
```

## Error Code Registry

All codes are declared by the `ErrorResponder::codes()` method in `src/Core/Error/ErrorResponder.php`, which returns the code => English-description array.

Code format:

- Key: uppercase string (example: `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`)
- Value: human-readable English description

Use centralized code definitions only. Do not hardcode error text in endpoint handlers.

## Error Handlers

Defined in `src/Core/Error/ErrorHandler.php`. These are plain functions (not class methods) loaded early in bootstrap.

### `generateError(string $rError, bool $rKill = true, ?int $rCode = null)`

Produces an HTTP error response. Behavior depends on the `debug_show_errors` setting:

```text
if debug_show_errors === true
    render styled HTML page showing error key + description
    if $rKill -> exit()
else (production)
    if $rKill
        if $rCode is set -> http_response_code($rCode) + exit()
        else             -> generate404()
    // if !$rKill, does nothing in production mode
```

Parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$rError` | `string` | -- | Key from `ErrorResponder::codes()` |
| `$rKill` | `bool` | `true` | Terminate script after output |
| `$rCode` | `int\|null` | `null` | Explicit HTTP response code (bypasses 404 in production) |

Examples:

```php
generateError('INVALID_CREDENTIALS');              // production: 404 + exit
generateError('API_IP_NOT_ALLOWED', true, 403);    // production: 403 + exit
generateError('STREAM_OFFLINE', false);             // production: no output, no exit
```

### `generate404(bool $rKill = true)`

Returns an nginx-style `404 Not Found` page and sets HTTP 404. The HTML includes padding comments to suppress browser-friendly error pages in MSIE and Chrome.

```php
generate404();       // 404 + exit
generate404(false);  // 404, continue execution
```

---

## Logger Subsystem

Defined in `src/Core/Logging/Logger.php`. A `final` class that registers three global PHP handlers to capture all runtime errors and log them to a file.

### Initialization

```php
Logger::init(bool $showErrors, string $logFile): void
```

Registers:

1. `set_error_handler([Logger::class, 'handleError'])` -- PHP warnings, notices, errors
2. `set_exception_handler([Logger::class, 'handleException'])` -- uncaught `Throwable`
3. `register_shutdown_function([Logger::class, 'handleFatal'])` -- fatal errors at shutdown

Also configures `error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED)` and sets `display_errors` / `display_startup_errors` based on `$showErrors`.

### Where Logger::init() is called

Logger is initialized in two places, depending on the request path:

| Entry path | File | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bootstrap (all contexts) | `src/bootstrap.php` | `XC_Bootstrap::loadConstants()` calls `Logger::init(PHP_ERRORS, LOGS_TMP_PATH . 'error_log.log')` |
| Streaming endpoints | `src/Core/Http/RequestGuard.php` | Loads settings from file cache, defines `PHP_ERRORS`, then calls `Logger::init(PHP_ERRORS, LOGS_TMP_PATH . 'error_log.log')` |

In both cases `PHP_ERRORS` mirrors the `debug_show_errors` setting (defaults to `false` when settings are unavailable).

### Error level mapping

`Logger::handleError()` maps PHP error constants to log level strings via `mapErrorLevel()`:

| PHP constant(s) | Log level |
| --- | --- |
| `E_ERROR`, `E_CORE_ERROR`, `E_COMPILE_ERROR` | `ERROR` |
| `E_WARNING`, `E_USER_WARNING` | `WARNING` |
| `E_NOTICE`, `E_USER_NOTICE` | `NOTICE` |
| All other `errno` values | `INFO` |

The shutdown handler (`handleFatal()`) checks `error_get_last()` for these fatal types and logs them as `FATAL`:

| PHP constant(s) at shutdown | Log level |
| --- | --- |
| `E_ERROR`, `E_PARSE`, `E_CORE_ERROR`, `E_COMPILE_ERROR` | `FATAL` |

Uncaught exceptions logged by `handleException()` always use the level `EXCEPTION`.

Errors suppressed with the `@` operator are ignored (the handler checks `error_reporting() & $errno`).

### Log format

Each log entry is written as a single line: `base64_encode(json_encode($data))` followed by a newline. This prevents line corruption from multi-line messages.

Decoded JSON structure:

```json
{
    "type":        "WARNING",
    "log_message": "Undefined variable $foo",
    "file":        "/home/xc_vm/Domain/Stream/StreamService.php",
    "line":        142,
    "log_extra":   "#0 /home/xc_vm/...(line): function()\n#1 ...",
    "time":        1716220800,
    "env":         "fpm-fcgi"
}
```

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Log level: `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `INFO`, `EXCEPTION`, or `FATAL` |
| `log_message` | Error/exception message text |
| `file` | Absolute path to the source file |
| `line` | Line number where the error occurred |
| `log_extra` | Stack trace (formatted string). Empty for fatal errors. |
| `time` | Unix timestamp |
| `env` | PHP SAPI name (`cli`, `fpm-fcgi`, etc.) |

### Log file location

Default path: `LOGS_TMP_PATH . 'error_log.log'`

If the log directory does not exist, Logger creates it with permissions `0775`. When running as root (common in containers), the file is chowned to `xc_vm:xc_vm` with mode `0664`.

### Screen output

When `$showErrors` is `true`, Logger also renders errors directly:

- **CLI:** color-coded terminal output (red for FATAL/ERROR, yellow for WARNING, blue for NOTICE)
- **Web:** inline `<div>` with monospace font, red border, and stack trace in a `<pre>` block

---

## Logging Pipeline: File to Database

The Logger writes to `error_log.log` on disk. A separate subsystem reads that file and persists entries to the `panel_logs` database table:

1. **Logger** writes base64-encoded JSON lines to `error_log.log`
2. **FileLogger** (`src/Core/Logging/FileLogger.php`) provides a secondary logging interface used by application code (PDO errors, EPG errors, etc.) that writes to the same file in the same format
3. Entries are ingested into the `panel_logs` table
4. **DiagnosticsService** (`src/Core/Diagnostics/DiagnosticsService.php`) reads from `panel_logs` for:
   - `downloadPanelLogs()` -- retrieves up to 1000 recent non-EPG errors, then truncates the table
   - `submitPanelLogs()` -- sends logs to the central API server for analysis
5. The admin panel exposes these logs under **Management > Logs > Panel Errors**

### FileLogger noise filtering

`FileLogger::log()` skips entries that match:

- Messages containing `panel_logs` in the extra field (prevents recursive logging)
- Messages matching `timeout exceeded`, `lock wait timeout`, or `duplicate entry` (noisy MySQL errors)

---

## Other Loggers

The `src/Core/Logging/` directory contains additional specialized loggers:

| Class | File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Logger` | `Logger.php` | Global PHP error/exception/fatal handler (described above) |
| `FileLogger` | `FileLogger.php` | Application-level logging (PDO errors, EPG, etc.) to `error_log.log` |
| `DatabaseLogger` | `DatabaseLogger.php` | Client streaming request events to `client_request.log` (ingested into `client_logs` table) |
| `UpdateLogger` | `UpdateLogger.php` | System update operations to `MAIN_HOME/update.log` (plain text, not base64) |

All loggers except `UpdateLogger` implement `LoggerInterface` and write base64-encoded JSON.

---

## Exception Types in the Codebase

The codebase defines a small number of custom exception classes. All uncaught exceptions are caught by `Logger::handleException()`, which logs the full exception chain (including `getPrevious()`).

| Exception class | Base class | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DropboxException` | `\Exception` | `src/Core/Storage/DropboxException.php` |
| `M3uParser\Exception` | `\Exception` | `src/vendor/gemorroj/m3u-parser/src/Exception.php` |
| `DataBuildingException` | `\RuntimeException` | `src/vendor/chrisyue/php-m3u8/src/Parser/DataBuildingException.php` |
| `DefinitionException` | `\RuntimeException` | `src/vendor/chrisyue/php-m3u8/src/Definition/DefinitionException.php` |
| `DumpingException` | `\RuntimeException` | `src/vendor/chrisyue/php-m3u8/src/Dumper/DumpingException.php` |

Most application code uses generic `Exception` throws or relies on PHP's built-in error system. The Logger's exception handler accepts any `Throwable`.

---

## Debug vs Production

### Production (default: `debug_show_errors = false`)

- `generateError()` returns a generic 404 page (or the explicit HTTP code), hiding the internal failure reason
- Logger still writes all errors to `error_log.log` on disk
- `display_errors` and `display_startup_errors` are set to `'0'`
- Errors are only visible through the admin panel (Panel Errors page) or log files

### Debug (`debug_show_errors = true`)

- `generateError()` shows a styled page with the error key and mapped description
- Logger additionally renders errors on screen (color-coded CLI output or inline HTML)
- `display_errors` and `display_startup_errors` are set to `'1'`

Do not enable debug display on production nodes.

---

## Bootstrap Error Handler Registration

The error handling infrastructure is loaded early in the boot sequence:

1. `bootstrap.php` defines `MAIN_HOME` and registers the Composer autoloader
2. `XC_Bootstrap::loadConstants()` loads (in order):
   - `Core/Error/ErrorHandler.php` -- defines `generateError()` and `generate404()` (loaded globally via Composer `autoload.files`); the code catalogue itself is `ErrorResponder::codes()` in `Core/Error/ErrorResponder.php`
   - Path and config files
   - `Core/Logging/Logger.php` -- class definition
3. `Logger::init(PHP_ERRORS, LOGS_TMP_PATH . 'error_log.log')` is called, registering the three global handlers
4. From this point forward, all PHP errors, uncaught exceptions, and fatal crashes are captured

For streaming endpoints that bypass the full bootstrap, `RequestGuard.php` performs steps 2-3 independently: it loads settings from the file cache, determines `PHP_ERRORS`, and calls `Logger::init()`.

---

## Adding a New Error Code

1. Add a new entry to the array returned by `ErrorResponder::codes()` in `src/Core/Error/ErrorResponder.php`:

```php
'MY_NEW_ERROR' => 'Human-readable description.',
```

2. Use it in code:

```php
generateError('MY_NEW_ERROR');
```

Descriptions must stay in English for consistency with the existing registry.
