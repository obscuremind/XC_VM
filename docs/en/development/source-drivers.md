# Source Drivers

A **source driver** lets a module add a kind of live source that ffmpeg cannot read,
for example DASH with DRM, and run **its own engine** for it. The engine takes ffmpeg's
place for those sources only. The stream stays an ordinary XC_VM stream: the same stream
id, categories, bouquets, monitoring, Start/Stop/Restart, connections, archive and
thumbnails.

A stream can mix both kinds. With the primary on your engine and a backup on plain HTTP,
the stream fails over between the two with no extra code.

!!! info "Status"
    The driver interface, registration, producer selection, process recognition and
    source checks are in core. A few surrounding pieces are still planned, and until they
    land some stream settings must be avoided on driver sources. See
    [Current limitations](#current-limitations) before you ship.

For the module basics (layout, manifest, module class) see
[Module Authoring](module-authoring.md); for other hooks see
[Module Extension Points](module-extension-points.md).

## How it works

```text
stream_source: ["acmedash://prov1/demo-001", "http://backup.example/live.ts"]
                          │                                 │
           SourceDriverRegistry::for(url)          core: ffmpeg or native remux
                          │                                 │
              driver->buildArgv($ctx)          buildLive() / buildNativeLive()
                          │                                 │
                          └───────────── sources[] ─────────┘
                                          │
                     the supervisor (xc_fanout) or the PHP monitor
                     runs one entry and fails over to the next on exit
```

1. Your module declares a driver class in `module.json`.
2. The driver claims one or more URL schemes (`acmedash://…`).
3. When a stream starts, core looks at each source URL. For a URL with your scheme, it
   asks the driver whether the source is reachable (`available()`) and for the engine's
   command line (`buildArgv()`).
4. Core launches that command exactly like an ffmpeg producer, supervises it,
   restarts it, and serves its output.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Producer** | The process that produces a live stream's bytes: ffmpeg, `xc_fanout remux`, the proxy, the LLOD/delay/loopback workers, or your engine. |
| **Source driver** | Your class: it claims URL schemes and builds the producer command for them. |
| **Supervisor** | The `xc_fanout` daemon, which starts, watches, restarts and adopts producers. When supervision is off, the PHP monitor (`console.php monitor`) does that job. |

## Where the real stream URL comes from

Core never knows the upstream URL of a driver source. It stores the URL the operator
entered in the stream's source list, such as `acmedash://prov1/demo-001`, and hands that
string to your driver unchanged:

- in `available($streamId, $url)`, as `$url`;
- in `buildArgv($ctx)`, as `$ctx['url']`.

Turning it into something your engine can fetch is entirely your module's job. Two
patterns work.

### Pattern A: an id your module resolves

The URL names a channel, not a location: `acmedash://<provider>/<channel-id>`. The real
manifest URL, headers and keys are looked up **when the stream starts**, not stored in
core:

```text
operator / import   →  stream_source = acmedash://prov1/demo-001
stream start        →  core calls buildArgv(['url' => 'acmedash://prov1/demo-001', …])
your engine         →  runs the provider script: manifest id=demo-001
                    →  gets manifest_url, manifest_headers, media_headers
                    →  runs the provider script: cdm id=demo-001 (keys, if needed)
                    →  starts fetching; re-signs the URL when it expires
```

Use this pattern when the upstream URL is short-lived, signed, or needs keys. Nothing
secret or expiring ends up in `streams.stream_source`, in core logs or in `ps`. Keep the
provider definitions (which script, which settings) in your module's own tables, keyed
by the `<provider>` part of the URL.

### Pattern B: the upstream URL wrapped in your scheme

The URL carries the location itself, and only the scheme changes:
`acmedash://cdn.example.com/live/ch1/manifest.mpd`. Your driver maps it back:

```php
$upstream = 'https://' . substr($ctx['url'], strlen('acmedash://'));
```

Use this pattern when the operator already has a stable, public manifest URL and only
needs your engine to read it. Anything after `://` is yours, including the query string,
so the upstream URL survives intact.

### How the URL gets into a stream

- **By hand:** the operator types it as a source on the normal Add/Edit Stream page.
  Core accepts any scheme there.
- **By import:** your module can create streams whose source list already holds your
  URLs. A native "Script" kind on the Import Streams page is planned (see
  [Current limitations](#current-limitations)). Until then, provide your own import page
  that writes ordinary streams.
- **As a backup:** put your URL anywhere in the source list. Primary/backup order works
  the same as for core sources.

## Quick start

This walkthrough builds a module named `acme-dash` with the scheme `acmedash://`.
Replace both with your own names.

### 1. Layout

```text
src/Modules/acme-dash_9f1c0/
├── module.json
├── AcmeDashModule.php        # the module class
├── AcmeDashDriver.php        # the source driver
├── bin/
│   └── xcvm-acmedash         # your engine, executable (chmod 755)
└── migrations/
    ├── 1.0.0.up.sql
    └── 1.0.0.down.sql
```

Ship the engine inside the module directory, so uninstalling the module removes it.
Do not install it under `/home/xc_vm/bin/`, which belongs to core.

### 2. module.json

```json
{
    "name": "acme-dash",
    "hash_id": "9f1c0b7e4d2a6538c1e0a4b7d6f39e21",
    "description": "DASH sources through the Acme engine",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "requires_core": ">=2.5",
    "environment": "main",
    "source_drivers": ["XcVm\\Module\\AcmeDash\\AcmeDashDriver"],
    "start_timeout": 60
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `source_drivers` | Fully-qualified class names implementing `XcVm\Core\Module\SourceDriverInterface`. A module may declare several. |
| `start_timeout` | Optional, in seconds. How long core waits for your first playlist before it counts the start as failed. Leave it out for the core default (20–30 s). Set it when a cold start includes key acquisition. |
| `environment` | Must be `main`. Your engine runs on the main server only; see [Main server only](#main-server-only). |

### 3. The driver class

```php
<?php

namespace XcVm\Module\AcmeDash;

use XcVm\Core\Module\SourceDriverInterface;
use XcVm\Infrastructure\Database\DatabaseAware;

final class AcmeDashDriver implements SourceDriverInterface {
    use DatabaseAware;

    public function schemes(): array {
        return ['acmedash'];
    }

    public function binary(): string {
        return 'xcvm-acmedash';
    }

    public function buildArgv(array $ctx): array {
        $argv = [
            __DIR__ . '/bin/xcvm-acmedash',
            '--source', $ctx['url'],
            '--config', $this->writeConfig($ctx),
            '--playlist', $ctx['hls']['dir'] . $ctx['hls']['playlist'],
            '--segment', $ctx['hls']['dir'] . $ctx['hls']['segment_pattern'],
            '--hls-time', (string) $ctx['hls']['seg_time'],
            '--hls-list-size', (string) $ctx['hls']['list_size'],
            '--hls-delete-threshold', (string) $ctx['hls']['delete_threshold'],
            '--progress', $ctx['progress_path'],
        ];
        if ($ctx['ingest'] !== null) {
            array_push($argv, '--ingest', $ctx['ingest']);
        }
        return $argv;
    }

    public function available(int $streamId, string $url): bool {
        // Cheap and local: is the provider known and enabled? No manifest fetch here.
        $provider = (string) parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);
        return (bool) self::db()->fetchValue('SELECT `enabled` FROM `acmedash_providers` WHERE `name` = ?', $provider);
    }

    /** Network settings and credentials go to a private file, never into argv. */
    private function writeConfig(array $ctx): string {
        $dir = TMP_PATH . 'acmedash/';
        if (!is_dir($dir)) {
            mkdir($dir, 0700, true);
        }
        $path = $dir . intval($ctx['stream_id']) . '.json';
        file_put_contents($path, json_encode(['fetch' => $ctx['fetch']]));
        chmod($path, 0600);
        return $path;
    }
}
```

What core expects of this class:

- **No constructor arguments and no container services.** Core loads drivers without
  booting modules, because a viewer's request can start a stream from the lightweight
  streaming entry point.
- **Database access only through `DatabaseAware` + `self::db()`.**
- **`schemes()` and `binary()` must be instant:** no network and no subprocesses.
- **`available()` must answer within a few seconds.** Core calls it before a start and
  before switching to this source, in place of running ffprobe on the URL.
- **Exceptions are safe.** If any method throws, core skips that source and writes the
  message to the stream's log.

### 4. The module class

Keep your per-stream settings in your own tables, and clean them up when streams are
deleted:

```php
<?php

namespace XcVm\Module\AcmeDash;

use XcVm\Core\Events\ListensTo;
use XcVm\Core\Events\Stream\StreamsDeletedEvent;
use XcVm\Core\Module\BaseModule;
use XcVm\Infrastructure\Database\DatabaseAware;

class AcmeDashModule extends BaseModule {
    use DatabaseAware;

    public function getName(): string {
        return 'acme-dash';
    }

    public function getVersion(): string {
        return '1.0.0';
    }

    #[ListensTo(StreamsDeletedEvent::class)]
    public function onStreamsDeleted(StreamsDeletedEvent $event): void {
        $ids = array_map('intval', $event->streamIds);
        if ($ids !== []) {
            self::db()->delete('acmedash_streams', '`stream_id` IN (' . implode(',', $ids) . ')');
        }
    }
}
```

**Never add a foreign key to `streams`.** Saving a stream rewrites its row
(`REPLACE INTO`), so an `ON DELETE CASCADE` would wipe your data on every edit.

### 5. The engine

Your engine is an ordinary executable that follows the
[producer contract](#producer-contract). The short version:

- It runs in the foreground, one process per stream.
- It writes HLS to disk at the paths it is given.
- When `--ingest` is given, it also writes MPEG-TS to that unix socket.
- It appends progress blocks.
- It survives `SIGKILL` without leaving children behind.

### 6. Try it

1. Install the module and run `console.php status`. This installs bundled modules and
   runs your migrations.
2. Create a Live Stream with the source `acmedash://prov1/demo-001`, no transcoding,
   delay off. Save and start it.
3. Watch the stream's log: `/home/xc_vm/content/streams/<id>.errors`. Every decision
   core makes about your source is written there with a `[panel]` prefix (see
   [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).
4. Check that the stream list shows the producer badge **module**. That means core
   recognises your engine as the running producer.
5. Stop the stream and confirm the engine process is gone. Then kill the engine with
   `kill -9` and confirm that the stream restarts.

## Reference

### SourceDriverInterface

```php
namespace XcVm\Core\Module;

interface SourceDriverInterface {
    /** @return string[] URL schemes this driver owns, lowercase, without "://". */
    public function schemes(): array;

    /** Basename of the engine executable; stable across upgrades, unique among producers. */
    public function binary(): string;

    /**
     * The producer's argv. Element 0 is the absolute path of binary(); one element
     * must contain the full playlist path (hls.dir + hls.playlist). Core escapes
     * every element and adds the redirections and pid handling itself.
     *
     * @return string[]
     */
    public function buildArgv(array $ctx): array;

    /** Whether the source is reachable now; called instead of ffprobe on the URL. */
    public function available(int $streamId, string $url): bool;
}
```

Core rejects an argv whose element 0 is not an absolute path ending in `binary()`, or
that does not name the playlist. It then skips the source and logs why.

### `$ctx`

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream_id` | int | Stream id. |
| `url` | string | The source URL your driver claimed, unchanged. |
| `label` | string | The source's index in the stream's source list (`0`, `1`, …), for logs. |
| `fetch` | array | The stream's network options: `user_agent`, `proxy`, `cookie`, `headers`. Only values the operator set; a value equal to the global default is left out, so it never overrides your provider's own. |
| `hls.dir` | string | Directory for disk HLS, with a trailing slash. |
| `hls.playlist` | string | Playlist file name: `<id>_.m3u8`. |
| `hls.segment_pattern` | string | Segment file name pattern: `<id>_%d.ts`. |
| `hls.seg_time` | int | Target segment duration, in seconds. |
| `hls.list_size` | int | Segments listed in the playlist. |
| `hls.delete_threshold` | int | Extra segments to keep on disk after they leave the playlist. |
| `ingest` | ?string | Unix socket path of the fanout ingest, or `null` when fanout is disabled or down. |
| `progress_path` | string | Where to append progress blocks: `<id>_.progress`. |
| `errors_path` | string | The stream's log, `<id>.errors`. Your stderr is sent there. |
| `supervised` | bool | `true` when the `xc_fanout` supervisor runs the producer, `false` for the PHP monitor. |

### Source URLs

- **Scheme.** Every module picks its own, and one module may own several.
  - The format is `[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*`.
  - Schemes core reads (`http`, `https`, `rtmp`, `rtsp`, `udp`, `rtp`, `srt`, `file`, …)
    cannot be claimed.
  - A scheme claimed by two installed modules goes to neither, and both names are logged.
  - Prefer a name tied to your module (`acmedash`, not `dash`).
- **Everything after `://` is yours.** Core passes it to the driver unchanged. Validate it
  in `available()` (return `false`) or in `buildArgv()` (throw).
- **The URL is the source's identity**, e.g. `acmedash://<provider>/<channel-id>`. Keep
  identity in the URL rather than in a per-stream table, because each backup source can
  point at a different channel or provider.
- **The URL must be printable**, with no whitespace or control characters. It is stored
  in `stream_source` and shown in the panel.

## Producer contract

### Process

1. **One foreground process per stream.** No daemonising, no double fork: the pid core
   records must be your engine.
2. **The command line names the playlist.** Stop, kill, the cron's pid fallback and
   adoption after a supervisor restart find the producer by `<dir>/<id>_.m3u8` in its
   command line. Core enforces this on the argv.
3. **Stop is `SIGKILL`.**
   - The supervisor kills the whole process group; the PHP monitor kills only the pid.
   - Keep no state that must be flushed on exit.
   - Give every child process (provider scripts, helpers) a parent-death signal, so it
     dies with the engine on both paths. In Go: `SysProcAttr{Pdeathsig: syscall.SIGKILL}`.
4. **Exit codes.** Any exit means the producer ended, and core restarts it or fails over
   according to the stream's settings. Do not use:
   - `3`: reserved (the core remuxer's "unsupported");
   - `4`: reserved for a future "presentation ended, do not restart". It is treated like
     any other exit for now.
5. **stderr** goes to the stream's log. Write short, readable, one-line messages.

### Disk HLS (always)

Archive, thumbnails, the monitor, the stats cron and the non-fanout delivery path all
read disk HLS, so write it even when `ingest` is set.

- **Segment numbering.** Segments are `<id>_<N>.ts`, where N starts at **0 on every
  launch** and has no gaps within a run, as ffmpeg does.
  - Core deletes `<id>_*` on Stop and on an explicit Start.
  - After a crash, the supervisor relaunches you **without** cleaning up. Overwrite
    existing files; never continue a persisted counter.
- **Playlist format.** It lists basenames, with an `#EXTINF` for every segment, and
  `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` equals the first listed N.
- **Atomic writes.** Write each segment and the playlist atomically: write to a temp file
  in the same directory, then `rename()`. Segments are plain MPEG-TS; core encrypts on
  the fly where configured.
- **Retention.** Keep `hls.delete_threshold` extra segments on disk after they leave the
  playlist.
- **Timing.**
  - The first playlist must appear within the start timeout: `start_timeout`, or the core
    default.
  - After that, the playlist must change at least every `6 × seg_time` seconds, or the
    stream counts as stalled and is restarted.

### Ingest (when `ingest` is not null)

- **Connection.** Connect to the unix socket and write MPEG-TS, and reconnect if the
  connection drops. Under the supervisor the socket is always passed, and the supervisor
  confirms a start by the bytes arriving on it.
- **Packet format.**
  - 188-byte packets, aligned from the first byte.
  - PCR on the PMT's PCR PID.
  - `random_access_indicator` set on video keyframes; HLS segments are cut only there.
- **Audio `stream_type`.** Use the standard value: AAC `0x0F`/`0x11`, MP2/MP3
  `0x03`/`0x04`, AC-3 `0x81`, E-AC-3 `0x87`. Audio signalled as private data (`0x06`)
  disables the audio-loss check.
- **No validation.** The supervisor treats any bytes as a live signal and does not check
  the TS, so its correctness is up to you.

### Progress

- Append ffmpeg-style blocks to `progress_path`: `key=value` lines ending with
  `progress=continue`, or `progress=end` on a clean finish.
- Open the file with `O_APPEND`, because core truncates it between reads.
- Useful keys are `bitrate` (e.g. `bitrate=4200.5kbits/s`), `speed` and `out_time_us`.
- **Omit `fps`** if you don't decode frames. A missing or zero `fps` makes the FPS
  watchdog skip its check. Do not write a placeholder value.

## What core does for you

| Situation | Core behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Stream start | Asks `available()`. When it returns `true`, runs your argv as the producer; otherwise tries the next source. |
| Failover | Moves to the next source in the list when your engine exits. That source can be yours or core's. |
| Priority return (PHP monitor) | Every 5 minutes, asks `available()` for higher-priority sources and switches back when one answers. |
| Forced source switch | Asks `available()` before switching to your source. |
| Stop / Restart | Kills the process found by pid and playlist, then clears `<id>_*`. |
| Supervisor restart | Re-adopts your running engine by its playlist path instead of starting a second one. |
| Panel status | The stream list shows the producer as **module**, with CPU and memory from your process. |
| Codec info | Read from your output by the stats cron. Until then, the panel shows a placeholder (h264/aac). |

### Refusals

Core refuses your source by itself when the stream uses a setting only ffmpeg can apply,
because your engine would drop that setting silently:

| Stream setting | Log message |
| --- | --- |
| Stream type other than Live Streams | `not a live channel (type …)` |
| Transcoding, including the logo overlay | `transcoding is enabled` |
| Custom ffmpeg command | `the stream has a custom ffmpeg command` |
| Custom track map | `the stream maps specific tracks` |
| RTMP output | `RTMP (FLV) output is enabled` |
| External push | `the stream is pushed to an external server` |
| Forced input audio codec | `an input audio codec is forced` |
| Delay | `a source driver cannot feed a delayed stream` |

A refused source is skipped, and core tries the next one. If no source is left, the stream
fails to start. Core never runs ffmpeg on a URL with your scheme. On a node where your
module is not installed, your sources are refused with `no source driver for acmedash://
on this node`.

## Main server only

Modules are installed only on the main server, so your engine runs there. To serve a
driver stream from a load balancer, assign the LB as a **child of the main server**. The
LB then pulls the stream from main over the loopback like any other child stream, and
never sees your URL.

## Provider scripts and secrets

If your module runs operator-provided scripts, that is code execution as the `xc_vm` user.

- **Execution.** Run them as a subprocess with an argv list and **no shell**, with JSON in
  and out, a hard timeout, and an absolute cap on stdout and stderr.
- **Where scripts live.** Keep scripts as files on disk in your module directory. Let the
  UI pick from that list and show each script's SHA-256 fingerprint rather than accept
  uploads. If you do add uploads, gate them behind their own permission, not
  `edit_stream`.
- **No secrets in argv.** Core records the command line on disk, and `ps` shows it to
  every user. Pass credentials and network settings through a `0600` file, as the
  example driver does, or fetch them inside the engine.

## Media

- **Tracks.** Tracks in your TS (video, audio, DVB subtitles) reach TS and HLS clients
  unchanged. VLC, Kodi and TiviMate show DVB subtitles; browser players (hls.js, video.js)
  do not.
- **Renditions.** Separate audio renditions and WebVTT subtitles need **HLS renditions**,
  which core does not support yet. When it does, the producer contract gains a
  per-rendition output.

## Troubleshooting

Every decision core makes about your source is written to
`/home/xc_vm/content/streams/<id>.errors` with a `[panel]` prefix:

| Message | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `source #N skipped: <refusal>` | A stream setting refuses drivers; see [Refusals](#refusals). |
| `source #N skipped: argv[0] must be the absolute path of …` | `buildArgv()` element 0 is not `/…/<binary()>`. |
| `source #N skipped: the command must name …_.m3u8` | No argv element contains the playlist path. |
| `source driver reports <url> unavailable` | `available()` returned `false`. |
| `source <url> skipped: <exception message>` | A driver method threw. |
| `no source driver for …:// on this node` | The module is not installed or not enabled here, or its scheme was contested. |

When the scheme is contested or invalid, look in the PHP error log for
`SourceDriverRegistry:` lines. They name the modules involved.

If the stream keeps restarting while the engine looks healthy, check these first:
- the playlist path is in the engine's command line;
- the executable's basename equals `binary()`;
- the playlist changes at least every `6 × seg_time` seconds.

## Current limitations

These pieces are planned but not in core yet. Until they land, keep the following
settings off streams that use driver sources:

- **Direct source, direct proxy, and on-demand LLOD v2** (`llod = 2`) do not refuse
  driver URLs yet. They would pass the URL to a client or to a PHP reader.
- **The source probe button** on the stream form and the stream tools checks still use
  ffprobe, so they report driver sources as unreachable.
- **Saving a stream** that puts a driver source directly on a load balancer, rather than
  as a child of main, is not rejected yet. It would fail on the LB with
  `no source driver … on this node`.
- **Priority return under the supervisor.** The `xc_fanout` supervisor has no probe
  command for driver sources, so it does not switch back to them by priority. It still
  uses them on start and on failover.

These are planned as separate extension points:

- a module tab on the Add/Edit Stream form, plus a stream-saved event carrying its fields;
- a registry of import kinds on the Import & Review page;
- honouring exit code `4`, and `SIGTERM` with a grace period before `SIGKILL`;
- HLS renditions (multiple audio tracks, WebVTT).

## Checklist before you ship

- [ ] `binary()` equals the engine's executable basename and is unique.
- [ ] `buildArgv()` element 0 is the absolute engine path; the playlist path is in the argv.
- [ ] No credentials or keys in argv.
- [ ] A fresh launch writes `<id>_0.ts` first, with no gaps; the playlist is replaced atomically.
- [ ] With `ingest` set, the TS is aligned and has PCR and RAI; the engine reconnects after the socket closes.
- [ ] After `kill -9 <engine pid>`, no child process is left running.
- [ ] Progress blocks are appended and end in `progress=`.
- [ ] `available()` is local and fast.
- [ ] Your tables have no foreign key to `streams`; `StreamsDeletedEvent` cleans them.
- [ ] `environment` is `main`.
