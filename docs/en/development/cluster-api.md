# Cluster API (MAIN ↔ LB)

A load balancer used to reach MAIN's MariaDB and Redis directly: its crons, daemons and
streaming endpoints held the panel's database credentials and wrote MAIN's tables. The
cluster API replaces that with one signed, encrypted HTTP channel the node opens to MAIN.
This page is the protocol and the operator's view of it; the design record with every
decision and its history is [`docs/adr/0004-cluster-api.md`](https://github.com/Vateron-Media/XC_VM/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-cluster-api.md),
and the code seams each call goes through are in [Cluster seams](cluster-seams.md).

!!! info "Plain HTTP is the default"
    The channel does not need TLS. Every request is signed and its body encrypted with keys
    derived from the node's token, so a panel with no certificate loses nothing by talking
    over `http://`. HTTPS is optional and, when a certificate verifies, preferred — see
    [Transport](#transport-and-endpoints).

## What travels

The node always dials MAIN; MAIN never connects to a node (its instructions wait for the
node to ask for them). Every call is `POST /cluster/v1/<op>` on MAIN's HTTP broadcast port,
or on `cluster_api_port` when one is set.

| Direction | Carried as | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node → MAIN, needs an answer | an op on the control lane | `hello`, `heartbeat`, `token_refresh`, `conn_admit`, `commands`, `ack` |
| Node → MAIN, a report | an op on an ingest lane | `events`, `streams`, `conn_snapshot`, `queue_claim`, `queue_update`, `queue_enqueue`, `config`, `recording_complete`, `vod_analysis`, `artefact` |
| MAIN → node | a signed command the node's next `commands` call collects | `node.rpc`, `node.root`, `node.cache`, `conn.kill_worker`, `conn.drop`, `conn.close`, `config.changed`, `artefact.fetch` |

Two ops the plan lists are deliberately never served: `rpc_result` (a command's result comes
back inline with its `ack`, which takes 64 KiB) and `stream_bundle` (the replica's `streams`
section carries a stream's whole record, and a cache miss reads it from disk). They stay in
the op list because nginx's ingest lane is rendered from it, and the API refuses an op it
does not serve.

### Lanes

Events are spooled by priority and drained by the agent:

| Lane | What | Pace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | a viewer opening or closing, a stream's state | at once |
| P1 | logs, the node's inventory, its audit | batched |
| P2 | HLS touches | batched, only while MAIN takes them |

MAIN serves the control ops on the `cluster_ctl` FPM pool and the ingest ops on
`cluster_ingest`, sized by `cluster_ingest_concurrency`; half its permits are reserved for
P0 so a flood of logs can never delay a viewer. A node that arrives while MAIN is starting
is refused with `STARTING` and a back-off, never a 500.

## Authentication

There is no shared secret in a file and no bearer credential on the wire.

1. **Enrolment.** MAIN gives the node an identity (`node_uuid`, an Ed25519 key pair the node
   generates itself, MAIN's pinned public key) over SSH at install, or through a one-time
   code the operator reads out (`cluster:enrol-code`, approved with `cluster:enrol-approve`).
2. **The token** is minted inside the `xcvm_core` extension from the panel's root secret and
   the licence, bound to the node's uuid, generation and epoch. It never exists in PHP as
   plaintext: the node receives it sealed to its own key.
3. **Every request** carries a timestamp, a nonce and an HMAC over a canonical
   representation of the request, with the body encrypted (AES-256-GCM). MAIN replies the
   same way. A replayed request is refused by the nonce store; a request whose clock is off
   by more than the allowed skew is refused.
4. **Rotation.** The token's lifetime is `lb_token_rotation_min` (5–1440, default 60). The
   agent refreshes at half its life; a refused token re-keys rather than stopping the node.
   Revoking the licence stops new tokens being minted at all, which is how a fleet is
   fenced.

## Transport and endpoints

`cluster_transport`:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) | HTTPS first when MAIN's own certificate verifies, else plain HTTP |
| `http` | plain HTTP only |
| `https_preferred` | HTTPS first, plain HTTP as the fallback |
| `https_required` | HTTPS only; refused unless MAIN's certificate verifies **and** every active node has already reached MAIN over HTTPS (its agent reports the `https` feature) |

The URLs a node dials, their order and the transport are MAIN's *policy*, versioned by
`cluster_policy_ver`. A node adopts a policy that is not older than the one it holds, and
remembers the plain-HTTP URLs of every policy it has seen: under `https_required` with a
broken certificate, the signed challenge over plain HTTP is its way back.

Changing MAIN's address, its HTTPS port or `cluster_api_port` keeps the old endpoint served
for seven days so no node is lost; `cluster:endpoint list` shows what is kept and
`cron:cluster` releases a port once every node has moved off it.

The policy also carries the fleet's heartbeat (`lb_telemetry_interval_sec`, 1–3 s), so
changing it reaches every node with the next policy and no agent restart.

## Flows and modes

What a node does through the API is switched per node, on the *Cluster Nodes* page. A flow
moves one part of its work to the agent and stands the legacy path down.

| Bit | Flow | Moves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TELEMETRY | the server's stats: MAIN writes the `servers` row from the heartbeats |
| 2 | COMMANDS | kills, cache jobs and root actions arrive as signed commands |
| 4 | LOGS | client, stream, error, activity and on-demand records become `log.*` events |
| 8 | STREAMS | the node's streams come from its replica, its runtime state from its own store |
| 16 | CONTENT | recordings, VOD analysis and the encoding queue go through MAIN |
| 32 | CONFIG | the node's caches are built from the replica, not MAIN's database |
| 64 | CONNECTIONS | the node's viewers live in its agent's registry |
| 128 | DATAPLANE | relays and other servers' files go through the agent's loopback proxy, with tickets instead of the stream secret |

`mode` is the node's independence:

| Mode | Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | legacy | reads MAIN's database as it always did |
| 1 | hybrid | boots from its replica, may still reach MAIN's database |
| 2 | api | every connect to MAIN's MariaDB or Redis is refused in code (`LbDatabaseAccessException`) |

Moving a node up is gated (`ClusterAdmin::modeGate()`): mode 1 needs CONFIG; mode 2 needs
every flow, the data plane included, **and** the node's own connect audit clean — zero MySQL and
zero Redis connects for seven days. Moving down is always allowed, because it is the way
back. A crontab row whose role is `legacy` (today `cron:users`) is not sent to a node in
mode 2 at all.

## The node replica

While CONFIG is on, the node's caches are built from what the agent stored, not from a
query. MAIN serves the sections; `cluster:apply` turns them into the caches the node's
readers use (a shadow diff before the flow is on, so an operator sees what would change):

| Section | Carries |
| --- | --- |
| `settings` | the settings a node reads, never a secret |
| `servers` | every server's row, without liveness or telemetry |
| `node` | the node's own row and its node settings |
| `crontab` | the enabled rows whose role fits the node's mode |
| `cluster` | MAIN's URLs, the transport, the heartbeat, the panel keys, `min_proto` |
| `secrets` | the viewer-token secret and `OPENSSL_EXTRA`, each with the value it replaced and how long that is still accepted |
| `bouquets`, `categories` | as `cron:cache` builds them |
| `streams` (R2) | one record per stream the node holds, kept by deltas and a resync; with DATAPLANE on, its relay and file tickets too |

## Settings reference

| Setting | Bounds | What reads it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cluster_api_enabled` | 0/1 | the whole API; needs `cluster:init` and the extension |
| `cluster_api_port` | 0 or 1024–65535 | 0 serves the API on MAIN's HTTP broadcast port |
| `cluster_main_host` | hostname | MAIN's DNS name in the URLs nodes dial |
| `cluster_transport` | see above | the policy |
| `lb_token_rotation_min` | 5–1440 (60) | the token's lifetime; grace is `clamp(L/4, 5, 60)` |
| `lb_revocation_mode` | graceful \| hard | how fast a fleet stops after a licence revocation |
| `lb_telemetry_interval_sec` | 1–3 (2) | the fleet's heartbeat, carried by the policy |
| `cluster_offline_after_sec` | 10–300 (30) | silence before MAIN marks a node offline |
| `cluster_orphan_conn_ttl_sec` | 30–3600 (120) | silence before MAIN purges a node's viewers |
| `lb_offline_admission` | local \| allow \| deny | admitting viewers while MAIN is unreachable |
| `cluster_kill_on_line_disable` | 0/1 (1) | a disabled, locked or expired line loses its sessions |
| `cluster_ingest_concurrency` | 1–64 (6) | MAIN's ingest permits; half reserved for P0 |
| `lb_new_node_mode` | legacy \| api | the mode a newly installed LB enrols at |
| `servers_stats_retention_days` | 1–365 (30) | `cron:cleanup` prunes `servers_stats` |
| `cluster_audit_retention_days` | 1–365 (30) | `cron:cleanup` prunes `cluster_audit` |
| `cluster_agent_upgrade_parallel` | 1–50 (1) | nodes upgraded at once by `cron:cluster` |
| `cluster_db_allowlist` (+`_extra`) | 0/1 | firewalls 3306/6379 on MAIN to the fleet |
| `lb_scan_roots` | paths | the directories the node's scan RPC may list |
| `lb_partition_tolerance_h`, `lb_fence_drain_min` | 0–24 (12), 0–60 (10) | the lease's window past token expiry, and the drain after it |
| `lb_lease_fence` | 0/1 (0) | a node stops serving when its lease runs out |

```

The *Cluster Nodes* page is where a node is approved, its flows switched, its mode moved and
its state read (epoch, token expiry, the fence window that follows it — token expiry plus
`lb_partition_tolerance_h`, then `lb_fence_drain_min` — its queued commands, last seen, agent
version and architecture, settings misses, connect audit). It warns when the licence is
suspended (and, with `lb_lease_fence` on, by when the fleet stops at the latest) and when
MAIN's certificate expires within 14 days while the nodes may dial HTTPS. It shows the figures
MAIN records: command delivery and ack latency (p50/p99 over the last hour), queue depth, the
ingest permits in use per lane, the `cluster_ctl` pool's listen queue, and the recent audit.
*Rotate all tokens now* sends `token.rotate_now` to every active node that takes commands.
Saving a different activation key on the dashboard does the same, once the extension accepts it.
The *Servers* list's row menu carries the same per-node actions (mode up/down, rotate,
enrolment code, a link to the node's flows) and shows the `cluster:reenrol` command to run
for a re-enrolment over SSH. Every decision is written to `cluster_audit`, which
`cron:cluster` prunes.

### A cutover, in order

1. `cluster:init` on MAIN, `cluster_api_enabled` on, `cluster:nginx`, `cluster:pools`.
2. Enrol the node; approve it if it came by code.
3. Switch TELEMETRY, then COMMANDS, then LOGS — each is reversible and visible on the page.
4. Switch STREAMS and CONTENT; watch the node's settings misses and its audit.
5. Switch CONFIG, then `mode_up` to 1: the node now boots from its replica.
6. `cluster:seed-connections`, then CONNECTIONS.
7. DATAPLANE, once the node's parents and the servers whose files it reads are MAIN or
   active nodes, and its agent runs the relay proxy (the page refuses the switch
   otherwise): relays and file reads go through its agent from each stream's next start.
8. Leave it for a week. When the node's connect audit shows zero MySQL and zero Redis
   connects for seven days, `mode_up` to 2.
9. `cluster:db-allowlist apply` once every node is in mode 2.
10. *Drop DB credentials* on the node (or `cluster:strip-credentials`): the node's
    `config.enc` loses MAIN's DB and Redis credentials, then MAIN revokes its grant. There is
    no undo from the page: rolling back needs a config with credentials and a new grant.

## Limits

- **The data plane (Phase 8) covers what a node pulls from another server**, and only
  while its DATAPLANE flow is on. A child relaying a stream, a VOD or subtitle fetch and a
  created channel's items go through the agent's loopback proxy (`127.0.0.1:31290`), which
  signs each upstream connect with a panel-signed ticket from the R2 streams section (a relay
  ticket valid 24 h, a file ticket 6 h, both minted anew every 3 h and never moving a
  record's ETag or version) and checks each 4 MiB chunk of a file against its owner's
  signed digest. What it does not cover:
  - A parent or owner that cannot check a ticket (a legacy server, not enrolled or not
    active) is still reached with the legacy URL and its password, even with the flow on.
  - Streams started before the flow was switched keep their URL until they restart.
  - Relay bytes are authenticated at connect only, not framed: over plain HTTP they have no
    integrity (plan, D11). Files do.
  - The secret still appears on the node's own loopback: the local RTMP output
    (`rtmp://127.0.0.1/live/<id>?password=`) and the recorder's pull from its own
    `/admin/live` and `/admin/timeshift`.
  - MAIN pulls through it only once an operator runs `cluster:main-dataplane on`: MAIN then
    gets a data-plane key of its own and an entry in the signed node list, and its source
    probe, a node's certbot log, and the relays and files of the streams it runs go through
    `xc_agent run -role main`. Off (the default), MAIN keeps the legacy URLs. MAIN's key sits
    in `config/cluster/main_agent.json` (0600), outside `xcvm_core`, as a node's does;
    `cluster:main-dataplane rekey` replaces it and raises its generation.
  - A file ticket names the owner's box key as it was when minted: an owner re-enrolled
    since cannot open it until the next epoch's ticket (at most 3 h).
  - The node's own legacy `/api` stays served with the flow on. `api_legacy.conf` (Phase
    8's second increment) retires it only once nothing reads the node's files with the
    legacy `getFile` URL any more: its own flow on, and every server of the cluster, MAIN
    included, an active node with its data plane on. MAIN counts once
    `cluster:main-dataplane on` is set. A proxy is never a node, so a cluster with a proxy
    keeps every node's `/api`.
  - The flow can be switched on only for a node whose agent runs the loopback relay proxy
    (it says `relay` at hello): update `xc_agent` first. The agent publishes the loopback
    key (`relay.key`) only while it holds `127.0.0.1:31290`, and the node's PHP checks
    that the listener belongs to the key's owner. While the port is not the agent's (held
    by another user, or the agent is stopped), the node's relays and file reads fail and
    are retried: they never fall back to the stream secret. An agent that cannot bind the
    port tells MAIN in every heartbeat: the Cluster Nodes page shows *relay port down* with
    the error, and `server:diagnose` names it. The port is not freed for it: an operator
    finds the holder on the node.
  - `/xfile` has its own rate limit (50 requests/s per server, burst 100, answered with a
    429 the agent retries), apart from the viewers' 20 requests/s.
  - `cluster:rotate-stream-secret` does not exist: retiring the password is Phase 9's.
- **The licence lease is issued, checked, and enforced only behind a switch** (Phase 9).
  Every token MAIN hands a node (enrolment over SSH or by code, `token_refresh`,
  `token_rekey`) carries a lease signed by `xcvm_core`, capped at `min(token_exp +
  lb_partition_tolerance_h, iat + 26 h)`; when the extension refuses one (no licence, its
  clock gate, a revoked generation) the token goes out without it, and a refusal for the
  licence dispatches `ClusterLicenceLapsedEvent`. `xc_agent` verifies each lease it receives
  (panel signature, its node, server and generation, the window on its estimate of MAIN's
  time), keeps the newest in its state file and prints it with `xc_agent lease`.
  The fence that acts on it is built in the node's PHP (`Core\Cluster\NodeLease`) behind
  `lb_lease_fence`, which is **off by default**: with it on, past the lease's `exp` no new
  viewer starts on the node (`stream/auth.php`), and past `lb_fence_drain_min` more the
  sessions still running stop (`segment.php`, `key.php`, `live.php`), and the agent drops
  every viewer the fanout serves, judging the same lease, clock and settings itself. It judges the lease state the
  agent writes to `config/cluster/lease_state.json` at every heartbeat interval, whether or
  not MAIN answers: the lease's `exp`, and MAIN's clock carried forward on the node's
  monotonic clock from MAIN's last authenticated statement, so moving the node's wall clock
  does not move MAIN's time as the fence reckons it, and restarting the agent resumes it. Every
  uncertainty serves: the switch off, a legacy node, no file or a file the agent stopped
  refreshing, no lease, no anchor on MAIN's clock. The switch must be on *before* a licence
  lapses — it reaches a node in the replica's `settings` section, which a panel without a
  licence cannot sign. Where the node's `xcvm_core` offers it (`cluster_lease_state`), the
  extension judges the lease itself — against its own pin of the panel key and an anchor on
  MAIN's clock that runs on the monotonic clock and never moves back — and the agent's file
  is the fallback. The same verdict makes `license_valid()` true on the node, so
  `LicenseGate` lets it use fanout. The extension's verdict needs the node's `core.pin`:
  the SSH install pins it over its own session, and every other node that takes root
  commands is pinned by `cron:cluster` with a signed `node.root pin_core` (the *core* badge
  on the Cluster Nodes page, or *Pin core* to send it now).
- **The credential lockdown is partly built** (Phase 9). A node in mode 2 gives up MAIN's
  credentials with a signed `node.root strip_db_credentials` (or a credential-free
  `node.root install_config`), run by `xcvm_core` as root; when its ack reports a config
  without credentials, MAIN revokes the node's grant (`XC_VM::db_revoke`) and records
  `cluster_nodes.db_revoked_at` (`Domain\Cluster\DbCredentials`). Only an operator sends
  the strip (*Drop DB credentials*, `cluster:strip-credentials`), and
  `lb_new_node_mode=api` is still refused (`api_mode_allowed` is false): the cutover stays
  the operator's decision. A node MAIN already keeps credential-free (mode 2, or a revoked
  grant) stays so: a reinstall over SSH packs it a credential-free config, re-enrols it in
  mode 2 and grants it nothing, and no grant path (*Re-authorise MySQL*, `tools mysql`)
  reaches its host. `cluster:rotate-db-password` rotates the panel's DB password
  through `XC_VM::db_set_password` and sends each node below mode 2 that takes root
  commands a signed `node.root rotate_db` with the new password SEALed to its box key,
  which its root side opens and hands to `XC_VM::config_set_db` (only `db.pass` changes).
  Every other load balancer that still uses its grant keeps the old password until an
  operator runs `cluster:set-db-password` on it. The password never rides a command in the
  clear. `cluster:rotate-credentials` rotates the Redis password the same way, and the
  manual `cluster:lockdown` exists too (ADR 0004, Phase 9's fifth and seventh increments).
- The viewer-token secret can be *replaced* gracefully (the value it replaces stays readable
  for ten minutes, fleet-wide), but a full rotation — re-encrypting what is stored under it
  — is Phase 9's.
- A node's `whitelist_ips` is the admin's: a node no longer publishes its own addresses,
  because that column grants the legacy `/api` allowlist.
