# XC_VM Release Preparation Checklist

Step-by-step guide for preparing and publishing an XC_VM release.

---

## 1. Changelog

**Reset the build output, then generate the commit log (work commits only):**

```bash
make new                 # wipe + recreate dist/ ONCE, at the very start
PREV_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
git log --pretty=format:"- %s (%h)" "$PREV_TAG"..main > dist/changes.md
```

> ⚠️ Run `make new` here, at the very start of the release — it wipes **and** recreates `dist/`. Everything below writes into `dist/` (starting with `changes.md`), so `make new` must run **before** this and **never again** before building — a later `make new` would delete `dist/changes.md`.

**Update `changelog.json`** in the repository root — this file contains only the changes for the upcoming release:

```json
{
    "version": "X.Y.Z",
    "changes": [
        "Description of change 1",
        "Description of change 2"
    ]
}
```

The panel fetches this file from the release tag automatically via `GitHubReleases::getChangelog()`.

> 💬 Keep descriptions concise — focus on user-facing improvements and fixes.

---

## 2. Pre-Release Validation

Before publishing, verify the build works:

**Quality checks** (CI runs the same set on the tag — confirm it is green):

```bash
make dev-tools && make phpstan && make cs && make gates
php tests/phpunit.phar -c tests/phpunit.xml.dist
make dev-clean   # remove the dev tools afterwards, restoring the prod-only vendor/
```

> ℹ️ The Docker test install moved to step 6 — it requires a built `dist/XC_VM.zip`.

**Security scan:** runs automatically on push/PR via `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (Semgrep) — no manual step.

### Regenerate translated documentation

Documentation is written in **English only** (`docs/en`). The Russian tree
(`docs/ru`) is a **generated, committed** artifact refreshed locally before each
release — translation is intentionally **not** run in CI (it is slow); CI only
builds the committed tree. If `docs/en` changed since the last release:

```bash
make docs-translate      # regenerate docs/ru from docs/en (free, no API key)
make docs-build          # strict build — fails on any broken link/anchor
```

- `make docs-translate` re-translates only the English files whose content
  changed (per-file cache), so this is fast on an incremental release.
- **Review and commit the regenerated `docs/ru`** — it is included in the single
  release commit (step 5). Never hand-edit `docs/ru`.
- Documentation is published **per release, not per push**: `pages.yml` runs when
  the version **tag** is pushed (step 7) and publishes this release's docs as a
  versioned snapshot (`X.Y.Z` + the `latest` alias) to the `gh-pages` branch via
  `mike`. Edits merged to `main` between releases go live at the next tagged
  release (which is also when `docs/ru` is regenerated). The Material header's
  version selector lets readers switch between released versions.

---

## 3. Prepare Release Baseline

First, finish all feature/fix/docs work and make sure it is already in `main`.

Set the version variable once and reuse it in all commands below:

```bash
VERSION="X.Y.Z"
```

**Choosing `X.Y.Z`:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — bump **PATCH** for fixes/small changes (e.g.
`2.4.0 → 2.4.1`), **MINOR** for backward-compatible features (`2.4.x → 2.5.0`), **MAJOR** for
breaking changes. Hotfixes are a PATCH bump on top of the current release. `XC_VM_VERSION`
(set in step 5) must match the tag you publish in step 7.

> ⚠️ Do not create a separate version-bump commit/push at this step.
> Otherwise `dist/changes.md` will include extra release commits and force additional edits.

---

## 4. Deleted Files

Before building, generate the list of files to delete on update:

```bash
make generate_deleted_files
```

This runs `git diff` between `LAST_TAG` and `HEAD`, extracts deleted files under `src/`, strips the `src/` prefix, and writes the result to `src/migrations/deleted_files.txt`.

If `LAST_TAG` cannot be auto-detected (no network / no releases), pass it explicitly:

```bash
make generate_deleted_files LAST_TAG=1.2.16
```

**Review the generated file** — verify no critical files are listed by mistake:

```bash
cat src/migrations/deleted_files.txt
```

After validation, `make lb` packs the file into the LB archive via the `lb_delete_files_list` target; on MAIN the file simply rides along in the full-tree copy (there is no separate `delete_files_list` target).

During `php console.php update post-update`, `MigrationRunner::runFileCleanup()` reads it and deletes the listed files automatically.

> ⚠️ Lines starting with `#` are comments and will be ignored. You can comment out files you want to keep.

---

## 5. Update Version and Create a Single Release Commit

Edit the version constant, disable the phpMiniAdmin access flag, and clear its password in:

> **Why disable `DB_ACCESS_ENABLED` / clear `DB_ACCESS_PWD`?** phpMiniAdmin is a raw
> database console handy in development, but shipping it **enabled** would expose the DB to
> anyone who reaches the panel. This step is a security hardening gate — a release must never
> go out with it on.


```text
src/Core/Config/ConstantsInitializer.php
```

These frequently-edited constants are `define()`s at the **top of the file** (above the
class); `appConfig()` reads them back, and `init()` skips the already-defined ones.

**Quick commands:**

```bash
sed -i "s/define('DB_ACCESS_ENABLED', true);/define('DB_ACCESS_ENABLED', false);/" src/Core/Config/ConstantsInitializer.php
sed -i "s/define('DB_ACCESS_PWD', '[^']*');/define('DB_ACCESS_PWD', '');/" src/Core/Config/ConstantsInitializer.php
sed -i "s/define('XC_VM_VERSION', '[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+');/define('XC_VM_VERSION', '${VERSION}');/" src/Core/Config/ConstantsInitializer.php
```

**Create one final release commit/push:**

```bash
git add src/Core/Config/ConstantsInitializer.php changelog.json src/migrations/deleted_files.txt
git add docs/en docs/ru   # include any doc edits + the regenerated ru (step 2)
git commit -m "Prepare release ${VERSION}"
git push
```

> ⚠️ This removes the need for multiple release commits.

---

## 6. Build Archives

> 🤖 **Production builds** are handled by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`) when a release is published. Assets are attached automatically.

**For local builds:**

```bash
make lb
make main
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** run `make new` here — `dist/` was already reset in step 1, and re-running it would delete `dist/changes.md`. The build targets write into the existing `dist/`.

After building, `dist/` should contain:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `XC_VM.zip` | MAIN installer (install script + xc_vm.tar.gz) |
| `xc_vm.tar.gz` | MAIN archive (install & update) |
| `loadbalancer.tar.gz` | LB archive (install & update) |
| `hashes.md5` | MD5 checksums |

> The same archive is used for both clean installation and updates.
> The update script (`src/update`) filters out binary/config directories at runtime using the hardcoded `UPDATE_EXCLUDE_DIRS` list inside the Python script itself.

**Verify integrity:**

```bash
cd dist && md5sum -c hashes.md5
```

**Docker test install** (see `tools/test-install/`) — only after building, since it needs `dist/XC_VM.zip`:

```bash
bash tools/test-install/test_release.sh
```

This builds the image, starts the container with systemd, and runs the installer automatically.
`dist/XC_VM.zip` is mounted into the container as a read-only volume.

> ✅ Verify the panel loads at `http://localhost:8880` and admin login works.

---

## 7. GitHub Release

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Vateron-Media/XC_VM/releases)
2. Create a new release with the tag from the first step
3. Paste the changelog as the release description
4. Publish **without attaching files** — GitHub Actions will build and attach them

After publishing, the workflow will automatically:

- Build all archives + checksums
- Attach them to the release
- Send a Telegram notification via `release-notifier.yml`
- Publish this version's documentation to GitHub Pages via `pages.yml` (mike):
  a `X.Y.Z` snapshot plus the `latest` alias, selectable from the docs header

> ✅ Wait for the Actions workflow to finish, then verify all files are downloadable.

---

## 8. Post-Release

> **MAIN before LB.** Update the **MAIN** node first. Its `post-update` broadcasts an `update`
> signal to every LB when `auto_update_lbs` is on, so LBs follow automatically; keep MAIN and LB
> on the **same version** — LBs read MAIN's database and a schema/behaviour skew can break
> streaming. Don't leave LBs a release behind.


- [ ] Verify all 4 assets are attached to the release
- [ ] Run `md5sum -c hashes.md5` on downloaded files
- [ ] Check Telegram notification was sent
- [ ] Close related GitHub issues/milestones

---

## If something goes wrong

- **Actions build failed after publishing** — the release has no (or partial) assets. Re-run the
  failed workflow from the Actions tab; if the tag itself is wrong, delete the release **and** the
  tag (`git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z`), fix, and re-tag. Don't leave a published release with
  missing assets — panels fetch `hashes.md5` / archives from it.
- **A released asset is broken** — publish a **PATCH** hotfix release (new tag) rather than editing
  a published one; clients pin to a tag.
- **A bad release already reached servers** — operators can downgrade per-server from the panel
  (**Servers → Rollback Version**, see [Update Mechanism → Rollback](../administration/update-system.md#rollback-downgrade)); on MAIN a DB backup is taken automatically first. Migrations are
  forward-only, so prefer a roll-*forward* hotfix when the fix is small.

## Command Reference

Every `make` target used during release prep, in one place.

**Quality checks** — run `make dev-tools` first, `make dev-clean` when done:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make dev-tools` | Install dev tooling (PHPStan, phpcs) via `composer install` |
| `make phpstan` | Static analysis (also catches syntax errors) |
| `make phpstan-baseline` | Regenerate the PHPStan baseline |
| `make cs` | Code-style check — import/namespace hygiene (phpcs + Slevomat) |
| `make cs-fix` | Apply code-style fixes in place |
| `make gates` | PSR-4 regression gates (procedural-use, LB-archive, vendor-prod-only) |
| `make dev-clean` | Remove the dev tools again, restoring the production-only `vendor/` |
| `php tests/phpunit.phar -c tests/phpunit.xml.dist` | Unit tests |

**Release prep & build:**

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make generate_deleted_files` | Regenerate `src/migrations/deleted_files.txt` |
| `make new` | Wipe + recreate `dist/` — run ONCE at the start (step 1), before writing `dist/changes.md`; never again before building |
| `make lb` | Build the LoadBalancer archive into `dist/` |
| `make main` | Build the MAIN archive into `dist/` |
| `bash tools/test-install/test_release.sh` | Docker install test of the built release |

**Documentation** (English source in `docs/en`; `docs/ru` is generated + committed):

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make docs-venv` | One-time: local venv (build + translation deps) |
| `make docs-translate` | Regenerate `docs/ru` from `docs/en` (before a release) |
| `make docs-build` | Strict MkDocs build into `./build/site` (what CI runs) |
| `make docs-serve` | Live docs preview at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
