| --- | --- | --- |
| **20.04** | Focal Fossa | ⚠️ *Outdated* — installation possible, but some packages may need to be installed manually |
| **22.04** | Jammy Jellyfish | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **24.04** | Noble Numbat | ✅ **Recommended** |

### Debian

| Version    | Codename   | Status                |

---

### 💡 Recommendations

For new installations:

* 🟢 **Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 LTS**
* 🟢 **Debian 12**

> ⚠️ Ubuntu 18.04 is in legacy mode — it works but receives no priority fixes.

---

## 📥 Quick Install

> ✅ Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 11+

```bash
# 1. Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y

# 2. Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y curl wget python3 unzip

# 3. Download latest release
latest_version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Vateron-Media/XC_VM/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name":' | cut -d '"' -f 4)
wget "https://github.com/Vateron-Media/XC_VM/releases/download/${latest_version}/XC_VM.zip"

# 4. Unpack and install
unzip XC_VM.zip
sudo python3 install
```

### 🧪 Beta Install

To install the latest **beta** (pre-release) version:

```bash
# 1. Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y

# 2. Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y curl wget python3-pip unzip

# 3. Download latest beta release
beta_version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Vateron-Media/XC_VM/releases | grep -m1 '"tag_name":' | cut -d '"' -f 4)
wget "https://github.com/Vateron-Media/XC_VM/releases/download/${beta_version}/XC_VM.zip"

## 🧰 Service Management

```bash
sudo systemctl start xc_vm     # Start
sudo systemctl stop xc_vm      # Stop
sudo systemctl restart xc_vm   # Restart
sudo systemctl status xc_vm    # Status
sudo /home/xc_vm/bin/nginx/sbin/nginx -s reload    # Reload Nginx config
journalctl -u xc_vm -f         # Live logs
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting — Panel Won't Start

If the panel fails to start, check the following logs and commands:

**Nginx error log:**

```bash
cat /home/xc_vm/bin/nginx/logs/error.log
```

**PHP-FPM log:**

```bash
cat /home/xc_vm/bin/php/var/log/php-fpm.log
```

**Verify PHP binary works:**

```bash
/home/xc_vm/bin/php/bin/php -v
```

> If PHP fails to run, the panel cannot start at all — fix PHP issues first before investigating Nginx.

## 🧮 Server Requirements & Sizing

### 🔧 Minimum Specs

| Component | Recommendation                |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| CPU       | 6+ cores (Xeon/Ryzen)         |
| RAM       | 16–32 GB                      |
| Disk      | SSD/NVMe, 480+ GB             |
| Network   | Dedicated 1 Gbps port         |
| OS        | Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+ (clean install) |

---

### 📊 Planning Formulae

* **Bandwidth (Mbps)** = Channels × Bitrate
* **Max Users** = Bandwidth ÷ Stream Bitrate

```text
Example:
HD bitrate = 4 Mbps
1 Gbps = ~940 usable Mbps

→ Max Channels: 940 ÷ 4 = ~235
→ Max Users:    940 ÷ 4 = ~235
```

> ⚠️ 10 users watching the same channel = 10× bandwidth (unless caching or multicast used)

---

### 💻 RAM & CPU Usage

| Resource         | Load per Stream |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| RAM              | 50–100 MB       |
| CPU (transcoded) | ~1 core         |

---

### ⚠️ Legal & Project Independence Notice

**XC_VM** is an independent software project and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by XUI.one**.

All backend systems, core logic, and infrastructure of XC_VM have been **independently developed** without using source code from XUI.one or related projects.

The administrative interface (UI/UX) is **inspired by general industry practices and partially by XUI.one in terms of usability concepts only**.
No proprietary source code or protected assets have been intentionally reused.

### 📜 License Enforcement (AGPL-3.0)

XC_VM is distributed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

Under this license:

* Redistribution or modification is permitted **only under the same license (AGPL-3.0)**
* Any modified version **must remain open-source**
* Providing XC_VM as a service **requires making the source code available**
* **Copyright and attribution must be preserved**

Any attempt to redistribute this software under a different license, remove attribution, or obscure the origin of the project constitutes a violation of the license terms.

#### Attribution-integrity check

As permitted by **AGPL-3.0 §7(b)** (preservation of author attributions), the panel
verifies on each request that its attribution notice — the *"Vateron Media · AGPL-3.0"*
credit shown in the panel footer — is still present. If the notice has been removed, the
**management UI** (admin / reseller / player panels) is locked with an
`ATTRIBUTION_REMOVED` notice until it is restored. The check is fully reversible and
non-destructive: no data is modified, the CLI remains available, and restoring the notice
unlocks the panel on the next request. End-viewer streaming is **not** affected by this check.

> ⚖️ You are solely responsible for how it is used.
> We take no responsibility for misuse or illegal deployments.
