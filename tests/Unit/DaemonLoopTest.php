 * A daemon's loop must not end in an unconditional `break`.
 *
 * Four of them did (`queue`, `scanner`, `signals`, `watchdog`): the whole pass
 * sat in a `while` whose last statement was `break`, so every pass fell out of
 * the loop and `restartDaemon()` re-executed `console.php` — a fresh bootstrap,
 * settings read and database connect per pass, per node, four times a second in
 * the signals daemon's case. The plan's 24 h RSS and queries/s acceptance
 * cannot be measured on a process that never lives that long.
 *
 * A `break` inside an `if` is how a daemon is meant to stop (a code change, an
 * nginx restart, a dead database): only the unconditional one at the end of the
 * body is refused.
