/**
 * DatabaseAware — shared static database-access pattern for domain/module classes.
 *
 * Domain services historically used a per-class `setDb()` / `db()` pair where
 * `db()` threw if `setDb()` had not been called first. That forced EVERY
 * bootstrap path (admin, web API, streaming, CLI, modules) to remember to wire
 * $db into every class before use — and forgetting it in any single path
 * produced a runtime "setDb() must be called before use" fatal (it happened
 * repeatedly).
 *
 * This trait removes that fragility: `db()` lazily resolves the connection from
 * the central {@see DatabaseFactory} registry (its sibling in this package)
 * when no instance was explicitly injected. Since every entry point already
 * calls `DatabaseFactory::set()` / `DatabaseFactory::connect()`, the connection
 * is always available and explicit wiring becomes optional.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. An instance explicitly injected via setDb() (e.g. tests, or legacy
 *      DomainDatabaseWiring). Wins so overrides/mocks keep working.
 *   2. Otherwise the current DatabaseFactory instance. Not cached, so a later
 *      reconnect (DatabaseFactory::connect()) is picked up automatically.
 *
 * Each using class gets its own static $db (trait static properties are
 * per-using-class), preserving the previous behaviour.
