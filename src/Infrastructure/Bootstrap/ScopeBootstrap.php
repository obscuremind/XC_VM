/**
 * Per-scope request bootstrap contract.
 *
 * A scope bootstrap runs the session lifecycle (start/timeout/login redirect)
 * and then the framework + user context init (XC_Bootstrap::boot, $rUserInfo /
 * $rPermissions, session-integrity checks). It replaces the former per-scope
 * pair of procedural includes (`<scope>_session.php` + `<scope>_functions.php`)
 * that the front controller `require`d at global scope.
 *
 * Implementations still inject the legacy view-facing globals ($rUserInfo,
 * $rPermissions, ...) via `global` declarations — the ~140 procedural view
 * templates read them from scope — so behaviour is identical to the includes.
