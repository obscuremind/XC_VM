/**
 * RedisConfigHardening — disables the Redis admin commands XC_VM never uses.
 *
 * MAIN's Redis listens on every interface (LBs connect to it), so anyone who
 * learns the password could otherwise rewrite the server's config (CONFIG SET
 * dir/dbfilename is the classic file-write), make it a replica of a hostile
 * host, load a module or shut it down. Renaming a command to "" removes it.
 *
 * Kept on purpose: FLUSHALL (admin cache page) and FLUSHDB (RedisCache::clear),
 * EVAL/EVALSHA (Lua scripts). An operator who needs one of the disabled
 * commands renames it to a secret name instead of deleting the line: any
 * `rename-command <CMD>` line counts as handled and is never re-added.
 *
 * Applied to the template (fresh installs) and, by StatusCommand, to the
 * generated config of existing installs (bin/redis is never overwritten by
 * an update). Takes effect on the next Redis restart.
