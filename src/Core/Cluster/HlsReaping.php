/**
 * Who ends an idle HLS viewer (plan, Phase 6: "Connection close (HLS) —
 * agent reaper, 30 s after the last read").
 *
 * An HLS viewer has no worker to watch, only its playlist requests. The
 * legacy reaper (UsersCronJob) ends one 30 s after its `hls_last_read`. On a
 * node whose CONNECTIONS flow is on, that time only reaches MAIN in the
 * agent's throttled upserts, so a slow or cut link would end viewers who are
 * still watching. An agent that says `hls_reaper` at hello ends them itself,
 * by the node's own clock (a P0 `conn.upsert` with `hls_end` 1), and the
 * reaper here then closes only what the node ended.
 *
 * The exception is a node that has gone silent (orphaned): its viewers would
 * otherwise count against their lines forever. A CONNECTIONS node is orphaned
 * once it has been silent for `cluster_orphan_conn_ttl_sec` and this reaper
 * has itself watched it stay silent that long, so MAIN's own downtime never
 * orphans anyone: silence counts from max(last_seen_at, cluster_ready_at), and
 * while the fleet silence guard is up (ClusterHealth) nobody is orphaned and
 * the watch starts over. Its rows are then purged from MAIN's store
 * (orphaned(), ConnectionIngest::purgeNode), HLS and TS alike.
 *
 * A node that stops reaping for itself (CONNECTIONS off, mode 0, revoked,
 * an agent without `hls_reaper`) keeps counting as reaping for LEAVE_GRACE:
 * its touches reached only the cluster bus (conn.touch), so the store's
 * hls_last_read can be minutes old until the node's PHP, or an older agent's
 * P0 upserts, write fresh reads there again.
 *
 * In Core: UsersCronJob ships to LBs, which reap their own rows in MySQL
 * mode and ask their own agent (NodeFlows) instead of cluster_nodes.
