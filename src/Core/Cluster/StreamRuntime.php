/**
 * The node's own store of its streams' runtime state (plan, section 8: the
 * load balancer owns the `stream.state` fields "with a local copy"; section
 * 9, R2: its recordings "plus local recording.state override"; section 10:
 * a node in mode 2 reads no MAIN database). What the node's writers report
 * to MAIN (StreamStateWriter: pids, status, the current source, probe
 * results, progress, the created channel's build state; ContentSink: the
 * archive and thumbnail workers' pids, a recording's status) is kept here
 * too, while its STREAMS flow is on, so the node's readers take a stream's
 * runtime state from here and its definition from the R2 stream caches
 * (StreamSource, NodeStreams) instead of one row of MAIN's database.
 *
 * ```text
 * config/cluster/runtime/          0700, the node's user (the agent's directory's owner)
 *   .lock                          the writers and the seed take it (flock)
 *   seeded                         {"at", "server_id", "streams"}: the store is whole
 *   generation                     a count every kept write and every lapse bumps (seed())
 *   unsent                         {"at", "token"}: an entry holds what the agent did not take (resend())
 *   streams/<id>.json              {"id", "ssid", "fields": {column: value}, "unsent": [columns]}
 *   recordings/<id>.json           {"id", "status"}
 *   .<name>.<pid>.tmp              a write in progress
 * ```
 *
 * - **Where.** On disk beside the agent's spool, not in tmp/ (a tmpfs):
 *   a reboot keeps what MAIN's row kept, so cron:streams restarts the
 *   streams that ran, and a created channel keeps what it built. Pids are
 *   stale after a reboot, as they were in MAIN's row; every reader checks a
 *   pid against the process it names.
 * - **Crash-safe.** Each file is written aside (a dot file in the same
 *   directory), flushed to disk (fdatasync) and renamed in: a reader sees the
 *   old file or the new one, never a torn one. A file that does not read is
 *   no entry.
 * - **Bounded.** An entry per stream and per recording the node holds:
 *   cron:cleanup prunes the others (prune()), at most MAX_STREAMS and
 *   MAX_RECORDINGS in any case, each value at most MAX_VALUE (what MAIN's
 *   column holds). A write past a bound is not kept, and a node whose rows
 *   on MAIN pass MAX_STREAMS is not seeded.
 * - **Owned by the node's user.** Written as the owner of the agent's
 *   directory (xc_vm); a root process switches to that user first
 *   (SettingsAudit::asAgentUser) and keeps nothing when it cannot.
 * - **The current source** is redacted (Redactor), as the `stream.state`
 *   event carries it and MAIN's row holds it on a node with STREAMS on.
 *
 * **Whole or not used.** A reader takes the store only once it is seeded
 * (ready()): a node that switches STREAMS on has run its streams with MAIN's
 * row, so its first CLI reader then copies that row once (seed(), mode 1:
 * one counted connect), once the agent has delivered every event the node
 * spooled (the P0 lane empty) so that row holds all the node wrote, and
 * only if no write landed while it read. A write that goes to MAIN's row
 * alone (STREAMS off, or the agent took no event in mode 0 or 1) lapses the
 * store once it landed (lapse()): the next reader seeds again. A node in
 * mode 2 cannot seed; its readers keep MAIN's database, which refuses them,
 * until it is seeded in mode 1.
