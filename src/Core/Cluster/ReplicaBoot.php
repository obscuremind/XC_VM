/**
 * Booting from the node replica instead of MAIN's database (plan, section
 * 10, step 2; Core\Bootstrap\Stage\ReplicaStage). Lives in Core: it ships to
 * LBs, where Domain\Cluster does not.
 *
 * - A node in mode 2 (api), and a node in mode 1 (hybrid) with the CONFIG
 *   flow on, boots its CLI processes and web API endpoints from the caches
 *   its replica built (ReplicaApply), once an apply has built the settings
 *   and servers caches since the last reboot, and its streaming entry points
 *   take a lazy database handle then (now()). Until then it falls back to
 *   the boot through MAIN's database: counted in mode 1, as before this
 *   boot existed, and refused in mode 2, whose process ends at its boot
 *   (fails closed).
 * - `cluster:apply` always boots from the replica, whatever the mode: its
 *   work is to build those caches, at boot too (`service` runs it with
 *   `--from-disk` before the daemons), when MAIN may be unreachable.
 * - Nodes in mode 0, in mode 1 without CONFIG, and MAIN, boot as before.
 *
 * Once a process has booted from the replica (start()), its settings and
 * servers come from the replica's caches: SettingsRepository and
 * ServerRepository answer them however old. Any other query opens MAIN's
 * database, lazily, on first use: that is the connect ConnectAudit counts,
 * with its site, and on a node in mode 2 refuses (plan, section 10, step 1).
 * What the replica does not own, a mode 1 process reads from MAIN's
 * database the same lazy way (hybrid()): the settings and servers once an
 * apply handed them back, the crontab's jobs. `cluster:apply` and a node
 * whose connects are refused (mode 2) never do: they get the caches however
 * old, or nothing.
