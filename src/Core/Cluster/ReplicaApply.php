/**
 * cluster:apply's work (plan, section 9, Phase 7): turn the replica the agent
 * verified into this node's caches. The agent writes
 * `config/cluster/replica/blocklist.json` from the sealed, panel-signed
 * records it holds and runs cluster:apply; PHP opens those records itself
 * only from disk (below), with the agent's keys.
 *
 * ```text
 * cache            from the replica's blocklist
 * blocked_ips      ip   (a list of addresses)
 * blocked_servers  asn  (a list of blocked ASNs)
 * blocked_ua       ua   ([id => {id, exact_match, blocked_ua (lower case)}])
 * blocked_isp      isp  ([{id, isp, blocked}])
 * rtmp_ips         rtmp ([resolved ip => {password, push, pull}]), which
 *                  only MAIN's cron:cache builds; an LB read its database.
 *                  From disk a name is not resolved (caches())
 * ```
 *
 * The shapes are the ones cron:cache writes from MAIN's database, so every
 * reader (LegacyInitializer, BlocklistService) keeps its contract.
 *
 * - CONFIG off (shadow): nothing is written; the report counts, per cache,
 *   entries the database has that the replica lacks (`missing`) and entries
 *   only the replica has (`extra`). Both at 0 is what lets CONFIG go on. A
 *   node in mode 2 may not read MAIN's database: it compares neither the
 *   crontab nor the RTMP publishers, and the report names them under
 *   `unchecked`.
 * - CONFIG on: the replica is authoritative. It writes the caches, and
 *   cron:cache stops writing them from the database.
 *
 * The `settings` section (`replica/settings.json`) becomes the settings cache
 * together with the sealed `secrets` section (`replica/secrets.json`), which
 * carries what the allowlist withholds and the node needs:
 *
 * ```text
 * settings  the settings cache: the section's raw row with the secrets'
 *           live_streaming_pass, decoded as SettingsRepository decodes
 *           MAIN's row, so every reader keeps its contract
 * secrets   OPENSSL_EXTRA in config/openssl_extra, with the value MAIN
 *           replaced while MAIN still accepts it (OpensslExtra::adopt)
 * ```
 *
 * In shadow, and while either is missing or malformed, the report names the
 * settings keys whose decoded value differs from the settings cache, and the
 * secrets whose value differs from what the node uses: never a value.
 *
 * The other whole sections (`replica/<name>.json`, `{etag, data}`, written
 * by the agent from the verified `rep` record; see ReplicaSections):
 *
 * ```text
 * servers + node  the `servers` cache, in ServerRepository::getAll's shape:
 *                 every server's routing fields, this node's own
 *                 configuration, the URLs built here (api_url with this
 *                 node's own live_streaming_pass), liveness unknown (null;
 *                 server_online: enabled)
 * crontab         the jobs this node's crontab runs (CRON_CACHE), read by
 *                 LegacyInitializer::generateCron and cron:root_signals
 * cluster         compared with the agent's own policy (agent.json); no PHP
 *                 reads it, the agent does
 * bouquets        the `bouquets` cache, in BouquetService::getAll's shape
 *                 (BouquetService::fromRows)
 * categories      the `categories` cache, in CategoryService's shape (every
 *                 column, keyed by id)
 * ```
 *
 * In shadow they are only compared with what the node uses today; with
 * CONFIG on they are the caches, and their readers stop reading MAIN's
 * database once an apply has built them (owns()). A section that is missing,
 * names another node or is malformed never writes a cache: its readers go
 * back to MAIN's database, as before the replica.
 *
 * Either way the report goes to `replica/apply.json`. cron:cache applies the
 * replica too, every minute while CONFIG is on (minute()), so the caches
 * follow the copy on disk even when the agent has not run cluster:apply since
 * a change of the flow.
 *
 * The R2 `streams` section (`replica/streams.json`, the agent's cursor, and
 * `replica/streams/<id>.json`, one `stream` record each) becomes the node's
 * stream caches (ReplicaStreamCache): one entry per stream, in the shapes the
 * node's readers took from MAIN's database (StreamSource). Its flow is
 * STREAMS, not CONFIG:
 *
 * - STREAMS on: the entries are written, those of streams the agent removed
 *   deleted, and StreamSource reads them instead of MAIN's database once an
 *   apply built them (ReplicaStreamCache::owned). A record that does not
 *   read (or, from disk, does not verify) writes nothing and deletes
 *   nothing: its stream keeps the entry it had.
 * - STREAMS off (shadow): nothing is written; the report names the streams
 *   MAIN's database says the node holds that the section lacks (`missing`),
 *   the reverse (`extra`), and the parts and fields that differ (`differ`):
 *   ids and names only, never a value (stream sources carry credentials)
 *   and never the tickets. MAIN serves the section only while STREAMS is
 *   on, so this measures how far the files the agent kept lag behind.
 * - Without a whole section (no cursor above 0, no readable `streams/`) or
 *   with a file that names no stream, nothing is written either, and the
 *   readers keep MAIN's database.
 *
 * The whole sections are applied first, then the blocklist, then the streams
 * section: a node may hold tens of thousands of streams, each verified from
 * disk at boot within `service`'s timeout, and neither that nor a shadow
 * comparison that fails may keep the blocklist from being applied.
 *
 * From disk (`cluster:apply --from-disk`, which `service` runs at boot before
 * the daemons, when the agent may not run yet), every section is taken from
 * the sealed, panel-signed record the agent stored beside its `.json`, once
 * it opens and verifies for this node (ReplicaRecords). A section whose record
 * does not verify is treated as unreadable: it writes no cache, and hands
 * back one it owned. The report names the sections under `from_disk`
 * (`verified`, `unverified`), never their content.
