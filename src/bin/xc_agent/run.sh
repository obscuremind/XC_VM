#!/bin/bash
# xc_agent keepalive supervisor (MAIN <-> LB cluster API). Started from
# `service` boot() and by the RootSignals cron keepalive, as xc_vm:
#   sudo -u xc_vm bash /home/xc_vm/bin/xc_agent/run.sh &
#
# Runs only on an enrolled node (config/cluster/agent.json exists), or on MAIN
# once its data-plane client was switched on (config/cluster/main.json, from
# `console.php cluster:main-dataplane on`): there it runs
# `xc_agent run -role main` with MAIN's own key (main_agent.json). One
# supervisor at a time (flock), one agent at a time (the loop blocks on it). The
# agent exits 3 when MAIN has stopped the node (revoked, unknown, or its
# enrolment never completed; an expired token re-keys instead): the
# supervisor then writes `stopped` and exits, and
# nothing restarts it until the node is enrolled again, which removes the file.
#
# A binary MAIN's `agent_binary` just installed is on trial (xc_agent.trial,
# "<installed at> <failed starts> [reach]"): if it exits within 60 s of its
# start three times within TRIAL_SEC of the install, the one it replaced
# (xc_agent.prev) is put back. A run that lasts, an exit MAIN asked for, or the
# end of the trial ends it. With `reach` (an agent that says it writes
# config/cluster/reached at each heartbeat MAIN answers), lasting is not
# enough: the trial ends once it has reached MAIN during one of its runs, and
# if it has not within REACH_SEC of the install, the previous one is put back.
# XCVM_AGENT_HOME and XCVM_AGENT_REACH_SEC are for tests: sudo passes neither on.
