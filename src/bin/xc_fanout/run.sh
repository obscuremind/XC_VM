# xc_fanout keepalive supervisor (ADR 0002/0003, P2/G). Started from `service`
# boot() as: sudo -u xc_vm /home/xc_vm/bin/xc_fanout/run.sh &
#
# Runs UNCONDITIONALLY and re-checks for the daemon binary each pass (2s backoff),
# so a node that receives the daemon later — fanout_binary pulls it on first
# install / update / the RootSignals hourly self-heal — starts serving within ~2s
# WITHOUT a service restart (closes the fresh-install bootstrap gap; fanout_binary
# only pkills and relies on this loop to respawn). A crash is auto-restarted (the
# Restart=always equivalent, no second systemd unit). This script + the daemon run
# as xc_vm, so `stop`'s `pkill -u xc_vm` ends both and nothing respawns on shutdown.
#
# This file is git-tracked and deployed with the tree; fanout_binary only atomically
# renames the downloaded binary into this same dir, so it never clobbers this script.

# Single-instance guard. Hold an exclusive lock for the supervisor's whole
# lifetime: a second run.sh (a boot/keepalive race, or a manual start) fails to
# take the lock and exits at once — so there is never more than one supervisor,
# and since each supervisor runs exactly one daemon at a time (the loop blocks on
# it), never more than one xc_fanout daemon. `stop`'s `pkill -u xc_vm` closes
# fd 9 and frees the lock; the next `service boot` re-acquires it.
