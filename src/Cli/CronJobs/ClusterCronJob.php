/**
 * ClusterCronJob — MAIN's cluster API housekeeping, every minute:
 *
 * - expired token epochs are deleted, which erases their `z`;
 * - the replay cache and single-use challenges past their 180 s go;
 * - enrolment codes nobody used, and decided requests after a day, go;
 * - the blocklist's change log keeps seven days (also with the API off);
 * - MAIN's old cluster API ports past their seven days go, and so do those
 *   every node has moved off (ClusterEndpoint::release()); nginx's cluster
 *   config is rendered from the settings (also with the API off);
 * - the liveness loop runs once (the signals daemon runs it every second);
 * - nodes whose agent downloads artefacts are granted the admin's off-air
 *   videos they do not hold yet (ArtefactGrants::offerOffAir);
 * - a node whose agent is not the version MAIN pinned is offered that binary
 *   (AgentUpgrades::push);
 * - in the hard revocation mode without a licence, every node that takes
 *   commands is sent the licence fence (ClusterRoute::licenceFences);
 * - a node that takes root commands and whose xcvm_core is not pinned to this
 *   panel's key is sent `node.root pin_core` (CorePins::offer);
 * - with MAIN's data-plane client on, MAIN's own tickets are minted anew at
 *   each epoch and its agent's servers section kept current
 *   (MainDataPlane::refresh).
 *
 * The crontab row (`cluster`, role `main`) is copied to load balancers with
 * the rest; there the job returns before touching anything, as the cluster
 * domain classes are not in the LB build.
