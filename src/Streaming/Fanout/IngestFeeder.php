/**
 * IngestFeeder — how a PHP producer (the LLOD segmenter, the loopback relay, the
 * delay worker) pushes a stream's MPEG-TS into the xc_fanout daemon.
 *
 * Since ADR 0003 Phase E the daemon is the only thing that serves clients, so for
 * these producers the feed IS the channel's delivery, not a best-effort mirror of
 * an on-disk path that no longer exists. Three things follow:
 *
 *  - a short write must not tear packets: what the socket does not take is kept
 *    and sent first on the next call (plain non-blocking fwrite() silently dropped
 *    the remainder, corrupting whatever it cut through);
 *  - the producer's own loop must never stall on the daemon: writes stay
 *    non-blocking, and a backlog past MAX_BACKLOG sheds its OLDEST whole packets
 *    (the daemon resyncs on the next PAT/PMT);
 *  - a daemon restart must not leave the channel dark until the producer happens
 *    to restart: a dead connection is re-registered (a restarted daemon hands out
 *    a fresh socket) and redialled, with a backoff.
 *
 * Input must be whole 188-byte packets. The only partial packet ever in flight is
 * the head of the backlog after a short write; on reconnect its unsent tail is
 * discarded so the new connection starts on a packet boundary.
