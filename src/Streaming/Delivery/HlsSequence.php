/**
 * HlsSequence — keeps a stream's HLS `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` monotonic across the
 * off-air ↔ live transition.
 *
 * Two independent producers number the same client-facing playlist URL:
 *   - the off-air placeholder ({@see OffAirHandler::showNotOnAir()}) numbers its
 *     loop `floor(time() / SEG)` — a large, wall-clock-advancing value (~1.7e8);
 *   - the live playlist comes from the xc_fanout daemon, whose segment counter
 *     restarts from 0 for each freshly (re)started stream.
 *
 * On an on-demand cold start a player therefore saw the off-air sequence (~1.7e8)
 * and then the live one (~1) — a ~10^8 BACKWARD jump, which HLS forbids
 * (MEDIA-SEQUENCE must never decrease), stalling the player during warm-up.
 *
 * This re-anchors the live sequence to the same wall-clock base via a tiny
 * persisted per-stream offset, so the published value only ever advances, while
 * still incrementing by the daemon's own per-segment delta so segment identity is
 * preserved.
 *
 * The wall-clock floor is applied only where a player can actually have seen the
 * off-air loop: the first publish, a daemon counter that went backwards (a
 * restart), a publish gap long enough for the loop to have been served, or an
 * explicit {@see markOffAir()}. Applying it on every publish renumbered a stream
 * whose segments run longer than SEG seconds (seg_time above 10, or keyframes
 * that stretch segments past it): the daemon's counter falls behind the wall
 * clock, and each catch-up shifted every listed segment by one — players replayed
 * or skipped a segment several times a minute.
