/**
 * Content Sink
 *
 * The content a node reports about itself beyond `streams_servers`: its
 * recordings' progress, the pids of the archive and thumbnail workers it
 * runs, and the ffprobe results of the movies it holds. A legacy node writes
 * them into MAIN's database, as before. A node whose flow is on sends them
 * as P0 events through its agent instead ({@see EventSpool}), and MAIN applies
 * them only where the node is the owner (EventIngest):
 *
 * ```text
 * recording.state  {id, status}                 CONTENT  recordings.source_id = node
 * stream.worker    {stream_id, worker, pid}      STREAMS  streams.<worker>_server_id = node
 * vod.analysis     {stream_id, props}            CONTENT  the node holds the movie
 * ```
 *
 * While the node's STREAMS flow is on, the node also keeps the workers'
 * pids, its recordings' statuses and a finished recording's VOD (as MAIN
 * attaches it to the node) in its own store ({@see StreamRuntime}), which
 * its readers take (the recording's status wins over the one its R2 record
 * carries). A node in mode 2 whose agent takes no event keeps them there
 * alone, and writes no movie analysis: it has no database to write.
